<p class="ph2">MY LADY OF CLEEVE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>OF HOW WE CAME TO CLEEVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Yonder</span> is Cleeve!” said the sergeant.</p>

<p>I held up my hand and the troopers halted. The rain,
which had been falling steadily since noon, had now
ceased; and a watery gleam of sunshine bursting from
the sullen stormclouds overhead lighted up the crest of
the hill upon which we stood, and the well-wooded Cleeve
valley below us, than which there is none more beautiful
in all Devonshire. Behind us lay the barren surface of
the torrs—mile upon mile of rock-strewn, wind-swept
summits—thrusting their gaunt and rugged outlines
high into the air in spurs as varied as they were fantastical.
But at our feet the ground fell sharply away,
covered with a wealth of golden gorse and bracken and
scattered clumps of timber that grew ever thicker toward
the bottom of the valley; yielding nevertheless the
glimpse of a white road which wound its way serpentlike
down the centre.</p>

<p>Here and there also the glitter of water showed through
the trees, where some streamlet kissed by the sun’s rays
shone with the radiance of burnished silver. From
thence the woods rose in one dense mass upon the opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
slope, until they broke at length upon the very edge of
the rocky cliffs that guard this portion of the coast, and
beyond these again were the dark green waters of the
Channel.</p>

<p>It was a scene that at any other time would have compelled
my ardent admiration. The fertile valley nestling
at our feet, clothed with its rich carpet of oaks and
beeches, and rendered doubly welcome by contrast with
the bleak, treeless surface of the torrs through which
we had toiled since daybreak. But befouled with mud,
wet and weary, we were in no condition to mark its
beauties or to appreciate them. Moreover, though it was
yet early June, a cold wind was rising, rustling in the
treetops below us and bringing with it the odour of the
sea.</p>

<p>As we sat there upon the brow of the hill, the steam
from our jaded horses rising around us, we shivered in
our saddles. For the last two hours, save for a muttered
oath from one or other of the troopers when their weary
animals stumbled, we had ridden for the most part in
silence. Even Graham—gayest and most debonnaire of
cornets—had scarce opened his lips save to answer some
remark in monosyllables. And that fact alone was more
significant than words to prove to what a state of depression
the lonely torrs and the falling rain had reduced
us. He had fallen somewhat behind with De Brito, but
they spurred forward now upon seeing me halt. I had,
I confess, no great liking for Cornet Brito; though to
give him his due, had he paid less attention to the wine
bottle he had the making of a good sword. But his was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
coarse, brutal nature—sullen, revengeful, and without
restraint—alien alike in every respect to my own. For
I hold that a man may be forced to live by the wits that
Nature has provided him with—he may be forced to sell
his sword and service to the highest bidder—but he need
not forget, thank God, that he was born a gentleman.</p>

<p>As for Cornet Graham, he was a merry, careless-hearted
boy in appearance, with an eye for every comely maid,
and a mind, one would have thought, running only upon
the sit of his peruke or the latest fashion in sword knots.
Yet his slight figure and fair boyish face belied his nature,
which was as keen and ruthless as any of the
troopers plodding at our heels. Even now I noted at
a glance that though he was as wet through as the rest
of us, no mud splash soiled his clothes. And his white
cravat limp though it was, was yet tied in a fashion that
would have done credit to the Mall or St. James’s. Indeed,
to him London was the world.</p>

<p>“A curse on these endless hills!” said De Brito sullenly,
as they drew rein at my side. “Why do we halt?”</p>

<p>For answer I pointed to where some three miles to our
right, on the opposite side of the valley, and perched
apparently upon the very edge of the cliff, the grey
stone chimneys of a house rose above the surrounding
trees. Beyond this the mighty head of Cleevesborough
reared itself into the sky. And at its foot, marked by
the smoke which hung, motionless, in the heavy air above
it, lay the little port of Cleeve, to which it gives its name.</p>

<p>“Yonder is our goal!” I said curtly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>’Twas a sight to see the way in which his dark face
brightened at the prospect.</p>

<p>“Then push on, in the devil’s name!” he cried querulously.
“There is an inn at Cleeve?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” I answered shortly, my mind running
at the time upon far other matters.</p>

<p>“Who talks of inns at such a moment?—though an inn
there is, and a good one!” said Cornet Graham. “But
there is a woman yonder,—to see whose face is worth
twenty such wettings.”</p>

<p>“Perdition take the woman!” growled De Brito in
reply. “Give me a roaring fire and a cup of sack to
keep out this cursed wet! Burn me! Women are as
plentiful as blackberries; aye, and as cheap for the
plucking.”</p>

<p>“But not such as this one!” cried the younger man with
some heat. “’Tis five years ago, I swear, since I saw
her first in London. But she was accounted then the
toast of the Court by those most competent to judge in
such matters; aye, even by King Charles himself—may
the devil rest his soul! He deserved well of his
people, seeing that he did his best to be a father to
them.”</p>

<p>“So that, but for the accident of his death, we might
have had a second Castlemaine,” I put in sneeringly.
The mention of this woman, about whom the cornet had
raved unceasingly since he had learned our destination,
jarred upon my ears. He shook his head in dubious
fashion.</p>

<p>“You do not know her,” he answered reflectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
“Proud as Lucifer, she is no woman to play the wanton,
even to a king! Cold as proud, she is——”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, man! For shame! ’Tis my belief you think
more of this paragon of virtue’s face than of the business
that we have in hand.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” he cried quickly. “’Fore gad! Spies and
Papists are common enough at present, but there
is only one Lady Lettice Ingram, and—why, curse
it, Cassilis, she is one of the loveliest women in
England—the favourite toast of every tavern in
town!”</p>

<p>“Such is fame!” I remarked caustically, and fell to
scanning the house again. And I confess that the longer
I gazed, the more difficult appeared my task.</p>

<p>For these were stirring times, and it behooved every
man to keep a still tongue and a ready blade. All England
was divided into two factions. The one still clinging
to the restoration of the Stuart in the person of
James II, the other content to follow the fortunes of
Dutch William. Moreover, in every shire throughout
the country were the spies and agents of the French
king, working in secret to foment a rising among the
Catholics. For Louis XIV. must have a finger in every
European pie.</p>

<p>It was to arrest one of these agents—no less a person
than the Marquis de Launay—that I had been sent
hastily from Exeter, information coming to the authorities
that he was in hiding at Cleeve Manor, an old Tudor
mansion on the coast of Torbay belonging to the Ingram
family, who were staunch upholders of the old religion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and the head of whom it was whispered was already with
King James in Ireland, and high in his favour.</p>

<p>As I sat now, pondering upon the best way to carry out
my orders, I saw at a glance that, standing as it did
upon the edge of the cliff, to ride up to the front of the
manor would be to render it an easy task for our quarry
to escape by sea. Clearly, by some means we must gain
the beach, in order to cut off any such method of escape
from the rear. Accordingly, I told off the sergeant and
a dozen men for this duty, with whom I purposed going
myself, bidding the two cornets to lie hidden with the
remainder of the troop until dark, and to then follow the
road leading to the manor. Arrived there, Cornet
Graham was to surround the front of the house, but to
await an agreed signal between us ere he attempted to
force an entrance. Meanwhile, De Brito and twenty
troopers would ride on and overawe the village, a task
which I knew would be both welcome and congenial to his
temperament; nor was I wrong in so thinking. As I
made an end of my instructions, he drew his thick and
grizzled brows together in a sullen scowl that boded
mischief.</p>

<p>“You need fear no trouble from that quarter,” he said
grimly. “I know my work too well.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but none of your devil’s tricks here!” I retorted
sharply. “We are not in Tangiers!”</p>

<p>For a moment his swarthy face wore an ugly look and
his fingers sought his hilt. But he thought better of it.</p>

<p>“Leave me to do my own business in my own way!” he
muttered sullenly. “Give me the village and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
tavern—and slit me if I interfere with you in the matter
of the dainty doves yonder!” And he nodded in the
direction of the house.</p>

<p>His tone was one of such studied insolence that at any
other time I should have called him to account. As it
was, I shrugged my shoulders contemptuously and
turned to Cornet Graham. On my life, he had pulled a
little comb from his pocket and with this he was endeavouring
to smooth his matted periwig.</p>

<p>“Remember,” I said warningly, “M. de Launay is to
be taken alive.”</p>

<p>“If he is there at all,” he answered, “and this does not
prove a fool’s errand!”</p>

<p>“It is like enough to be that,” I said carelessly, “since
it is a king’s. But be consoled. At least, you will see
this Venus!”</p>

<p>He cried out something at that, but I did not stay to
hear. I gathered up my reins and, with a wave of the
hand, rode after the troopers.</p>

<p>They had halted at the edge of the road awaiting my
orders, and I saw that the sergeant had made a careful
selection for the arduous work they had before them.
As they sat there in their saddles, their fierce, swarthy
faces bronzed to a coppery hue by the scorching suns of
Tangiers, their coats, once red—worn and faded to a
mottled purple, they were as ill-favoured a set of rogues
as one could meet, not even excepting Kirk’s Lambs. I
placed myself at their head, therefore, and leaving the
road behind us, we plunged at once into the woods.
So dense were these that ere we had proceeded more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
a quarter of a mile I was compelled to dismount the men
and to send back our horses in charge of two of their
number. With the remaining troopers at my heels, I
essayed to make the ascent on foot. Nor was it an easy
task even then. From every branch the raindrops
dripped upon us, so that, wet before, we were doubly so
ere we had advanced but a short distance. Tripping
over roots, torn by brambles, a dozen times we came down
upon our faces, rendering us in a truly pitiable condition
when at length we reached the summit. Nor did luck
befriend us even then.</p>

<p>In front of us and on either side the woods spread to
the edge of the cliff, the latter falling sheer away to
give us a sight of the white-capped rollers, over which
the gulls were wheeling, three hundred feet below, and
with no sign of a path by which we might gain the shore.
We separated now, making our way right and left as fast
as the thick growth and the slippery nature of the
ground would permit, while in my heart I cursed the
delay, for the light was fading fast. It was not long
before a shout from one of the troopers proclaimed that
he had stumbled upon that which we sought. I made
my way to his side as quickly as possible, and found him
standing on the brink of a little combe, a mere cleft in
the hillside, its sides thickly wooded, and with a swift
stream, swollen by the rains from the torrs above, flowing
in a succession of white-lipped falls down its centre. It
was not an inviting road to take, and I would willingly
have sought for a more open spot, but we had already
lost more time than we could well spare, and dusk had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
fallen on the silent woods. Moreover, the heavy grey
clouds, drifting low from the direction of the sea,
momentarily grew darker and more threatening, giving
promise of further rain. I rallied the troopers, therefore,
at the head of the combe, and with the sergeant at
my heels, plunged into the glen.</p>

<p>At first the ground was fairly open, and we were enabled
to make good progress through the thickets of alders
and rushes that fringed the banks of the stream, but
ever as we advanced the green walls of the glen grew
steeper and narrower, until we were forced to take to
the stream itself, making our way from stone to stone
that lay mossgrown and prostrate in its bed, or at times
wading ankle deep through some shallow pool. It was as
if we were cut off from the world. A damp, earthy smell,
begotten of the winter’s leaves’ decay, filled the air.
There was no sound save the song of the water swirling
at our feet as it brawled amongst the pebbles and chafed
in its narrow course, the occasional fall of a branch upon
the hillside above, and in the distance the ever-increasing
murmur of the sea.</p>

<p>For over half a mile we proceeded thus, so that it was
with no little satisfaction that at length we saw the
light, such as it was, gradually strengthening in front
of us. Now the trees grew thinner, admitting a breath
of sea air, which stole through their twisted trunks and
fanned our faces. As we continued to advance, the glen
as suddenly receded, and a moment or two later we came
out upon the beach.</p>

<p>We found ourselves in a little shingle-covered bay, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
extremities of which were shut in by the rocks, giving us
no sight of what lay beyond. Above our heads on either
side towered a mighty wall of rock, its grey, rugged
surface broken here and there by patches of withered
grass. And here the sergeant, who was a few paces in
front of me, suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>He was a grizzled, battle-scarred veteran of the wars of
Flanders, with whom I had once made a campaign upon
the Rhine, and to whom for that reason I allowed some
freedom. His looks, ill-favoured enough at best, were
in no way improved by the scar of an old sword cut
gained in some wild foray against the Turk, which scar,
starting from his right eyebrow, stretched crosswise to
his chin; twisting both nose and lips to their utter detriment
and imparting a peculiarly forbidding and saturnine
expression to his face.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I said sharply. “Why do you halt, man?
The tide is out, and the light will serve.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered slowly, “the tide is out, but——”</p>

<p>“But what?” I cried impatiently. “Come, out with it
if you have anything to say!”</p>

<p>“Well, I like not that!” he rejoined with some hesitation,
pointing out to sea.</p>

<p>Following the direction of his outstretched arm,
away over the surface of the water, some two
miles distant, but creeping each minute slowly and
insidiously nearer, stretched a white wall of vapour,
beneath which gleamed the foam-crested summits of the
waves.</p>

<p>“Well?” I said contemptuously. “What of it? Have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
you never seen a sea fog before, or are you afraid?” I
continued with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Neither of man nor devil!” he retorted with some heat.
And to do him justice, I knew that he spoke truth. “But
this—this is different. To be caught against that”—he
nodded toward the cliff—“and to be drowned like
rats!”</p>

<p>I saw that his words were not without effect. The
troopers, already wearied by the day’s exertions, glanced
askance at one another and began to mutter. At all
hazards this must be stopped, and at once. I faced
round on them.</p>

<p>“Who talks of drowning?” I cried angrily. “Curse
you for a fool, man! ’Tis but a mile to go at most. But
if you fear to venture, sergeant,” I continued, “you can
return the way we came. And stay, I will send a couple
of men back with you to bear you company; you will
find it dark in the glen!”</p>

<p>He saluted at that, a flush of shame upon his face.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he said slowly; “let it be forward then.
Only—I have warned you.”</p>

<p>“And you others!” I continued in a fierce tone, turning
upon them and letting my hand fall lightly upon the butt
of the pistol in my sash. “Have you anything to say,
or do you forget who I am, you knaves? I will find a
quicker death than yonder waves for the first man among
you who questions my orders!”</p>

<p>I looked them squarely in the face, and their muttering
died away. Steeped as they were in crime and license,
I was their master, and they knew it. For a moment or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
two longer I remained silent to give full effect to my
words, but not a man spoke.</p>

<p>“Forward then!” I said shortly; and we set off along
the beach.</p>

<p>Not that their fears were altogether without foundation.
The intense loneliness of the spot, increased as it
was by the gathering dusk, was sufficient to daunt the
stoutest heart. The wind was rising, moaning in the
cavernous hollows and crevices of the cliff, from which
came ever and anon the weird cry of some sea fowl, circling
round its nest in the rocky wall above. And save
for this there was no other sound but the hoarse murmur
of the swift, incoming tide.</p>

<p>Rounding the rocks which screened the bay, we found
ourselves in a second one, a complete replica of the first.
And beyond us, headland upon headland, serrated against
the darkening sky, stretched faint and shadowy into
the far distance.</p>

<p>Our progress was slow, for the beach was composed of
small, slate-coloured pebbles, flattened and rounded by
the wash of endless surges, and into which our heavy
military boots sank deep at every step. Here and there
we were forced to skirt some mass of lichen-covered
rocks; which, torn from the cliff side, lay scattered upon
the shore at its base, their sharp, needle-like summits
wreathed with tangled seaweed and their caves and hollows
filled with the flotsam of the tides.</p>

<p>And now the fog rolled down upon us, at first in thin
wreaths of vapour that floated in ghost-like silence like
the first sentinels of an advancing army, but growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
ever thicker and thicker as they approached landwards,
until they wrapped us completely round in their damp
embrace, blotting out everything from our vision save
the wall of cliff upon our right, which loomed dark and
menacing through the mist. The wind rose as suddenly
to a gale, sending the fog wreaths eddying around us,
and bringing with it a cold rain that at every successive
gust beat in our faces, blinding and confusing us. A
hundred times I cursed my folly and recalled the
sergeant’s warning. He was at my elbow now, at times
his figure appearing distorted and giant-like as the fog
thinned somewhat; anon banishing altogether from my
vision, swallowed up by the mist.</p>

<p>How long we struggled on thus, buffeted by the wind
and rain, falling over the jutting rocks, I do not know;
but it was in a lull in the gale, when the wind died down
for a moment and the fog lifted, that I felt myself seized
by the arm and plucked violently backward. It was none
too soon. From out of the mist ahead appeared a green
wall of water capped with foam. Down it thundered,
breaking upon the pebbles at my feet, sending the salt
spume flying above my head and swirling round my knees
in a cataract of foam.</p>

<p>Even then, so sudden was the surprise, that the backwash
was like to have swept me from my feet; but the
sergeant’s grip tightened upon my arm and dragged me
back to safety. And in a moment I realised what had
happened. We had reached the end of the bay, into
which the sea had already entered. I put my lips to
the sergeant’s ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“Back to the cliff,” I shouted, “and climb, man!
Climb, or——”</p>

<p>There was no need to finish the sentence. Not a man
there but knew our danger. We began to retrace our
steps. It had grown so dark now that it was only when
the curtain of fog parted to a more violent gust than
usual that I was enabled to distinguish the form of the
trooper upon my right. The rain which we had experienced
all day was as nothing to that which fell upon
us now. It descended in sheets, drenching us to the skin
and numbing us with its icy cold. For a while, indeed,
a species of coma seized me. I thought of the cornets
waiting in the roadway above, and wondered idly whether
they would succeed in achieving the arrest of the man
we had come so far to seek, and whether, by chance, upon
the morrow they would find some relic of our party floating
in the wash of the tide to tell the story of our fate,
for I did not deceive myself. To climb the cliff even in
the daylight would have been a hard enough feat; to do
so at night, in the darkness and fog, was an impossibility.
And though I was willing enough for the troopers’ sake
to make the attempt—aye, and to encourage the effort—yet
in my heart I knew that there could be but one
ending.</p>

<p>It seemed hard, I remember thinking dully, that a man
who had passed unscathed through the perils of many
battlefields—hard for a man who had made a campaign
with Montecuccoli, and whose arms had held the great
Turenne as he fell from his horse, struck down by a
cannon-ball upon the banks of the Rhine—to be drowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
at the last in a little bay upon the lonely Devon coast.
I was aroused from these reflections by the sound of an
oath and a heavy fall, as the trooper upon my left
stumbled over a black mass which loomed up suddenly
in his path. He was on his feet again ere I could reach
his side, and gave vent to such a ringing shout that it
pierced above the gale and brought us all around him.
That which he had fallen over, very providentially as
it proved for us, was a boat anchored to the beach by a
short length of rope fastened to a stone. With renewed
hope we scattered again in search of the path which the
inmates of the manor must have been in the habit of
using when passing to and fro to this small craft. At
length an idea struck me, and raising my hand to pass
it carefully over the rocky wall above me at a little above
the level of my shoulder, I came upon a ledge. By
climbing upon the sergeant’s bent back, I was enabled
to draw myself up to it at the cost of a few bruises, and
to clamber upon its flat surface.</p>

<p>It was, as near as I could judge, some ten feet square,
and in the far corner my hands came in contact with a
flight of steps leading upwards, roughly hewn in the
cliff side. Five minutes later the whole party of us stood
upon a little platform, side by side. And then, drawing
a long breath, I essayed to make the ascent.</p>

<p>There were eighteen steps in all, giving place to a path,
a mere narrow ledge on the surface of the cliff, at no
place more than four feet wide, and with a sheer drop
upon the one side to the beach below. Along this we
crept, at every fresh gust of wind flattening ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
against the rocky wall upon the right and clinging to its
jagged fissures. It was a weird experience, I vow, to be
suspended thus ’twixt sea and sky; no sound save the
whistling of the wind in the crannies of the cliff, the roar
of the pitiless surges below us, or the harsh scream of a
gull from the mist out at sea. Yet I have travelled
this same path since by daylight, and I have often
thought that the thickness of the fog upon that night
was most fortunate for us, sparing us, as it did, the full
knowledge of the yawning which lay at our side, the
sight of which might well have turned the strongest head
giddy. Even as it was, at a place where the ledge took a
sharp turning, a sudden blast struck me with such
violence that, taken off my guard, for a moment I was
in danger of being torn from my foothold, and only by
driving my nails into a crack of the rock until the fingers
themselves were left all raw and bleeding was I enabled
to withstand its boisterous pressure.</p>

<p>The breeze passed. And taking courage of my experience,
I made haste to round the dangerous corner,
shouting back a word of warning to the file of men
creeping at my heels. Even as we ascended the noise of
the waves grew fainter, until, after travelling some
twenty minutes thus, a new sound was added to the patter
of the rain upon the side of the cliff—namely, the
howl of the wind in the treetops above us.</p>

<p>A last effort as the way grew steeper yet, and I gained
the summit, to fling myself panting and exhausted upon
the turf in the thick darkness beyond.</p>

<small>OF THE LIGHT THAT SHONE IN THE FOG</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> must have been for the space of full five minutes
that I lay thus, with quivering nerves and labouring
breath, upon the sodden ground, with the raindrops
beating down upon me, ere I roused myself sufficiently
to get to my feet and call to the sergeant. His voice
answered me from out of the night, somewhere at my
side. I bade him ascertain that none of the party had
got separated in the darkness. Accordingly, he called
the troopers one by one, and at each name an invisible
speaker answered: “Here!”</p>

<p>“They are all present!” said the sergeant gruffly, who,
though distant from me but some three feet or so, showed
only as a darker patch upon the murk beyond. It was
the very gloom of Egypt that encompassed us. Therefore,
I gave instructions that each trooper should lay
hold of the belt of the man in front of him, and setting
our faces away from the direction of the sea, we moved
slowly through the inky blackness that surrounded us.
That there were trees around us I had ample proof, not
only by the sound of the wind whistling in their branches
overhead, but also by the fact that ere we had advanced a
dozen yards I tripped over a projecting root, my head
coming into such violent contact with an unseen tree,
that I was glad to lean for a moment or two, sick and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
dizzy, against its knotted trunk. Thereafter I was
more careful, feeling my way from tree to tree, and
probing the darkness in front with my sheathed sword.</p>

<p>We had been moving a long time thus, or so it seemed,
when the trees on either side abruptly ceased, and turn
it which way I would, my sword encountered only empty
air. Across this open space we slowly moved till at the
thirty-seventh step as I counted my sword struck with
a sharp tinkle against what I took for the moment to be a
stone wall. It was not until I had passed my hand over
its flat surface and down its base that I discovered the
nature of the object upon which we had stumbled. It
was the sun-dial, such as I had often seen in France, and
I knew by its shape that I was not mistaken. From this
I argued we were somewhere within the gardens belonging
to the house, and here the man who was behind me
(it was the sergeant) loosened his hold, and I felt him
groping upon the ground at my feet. Presently he rose,
as I could tell by the sound of his voice.</p>

<p>“There is a path here,” he said; “I can feel its border.
Aye, and a broad one.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” I answered, “lead on! The house cannot
be far away.”</p>

<p>I resigned my place to him, therefore, at the head, and
with frequent stoppages we made our way slowly along
the path. A dozen times at least we strayed from the
track, and it was only with the greatest patience that we
were enabled to retrace our steps. We must have
travelled thus for some five or six hundred yards, when
we almost ran into a stone wall, that lay on the right-hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> 
side of the path, and saw before us a dark mass
looming through the mist. We felt our way by the side
of this wall until, upon turning sharply round the
corner, the sergeant’s hand was laid upon my arm, and
we came to a sudden halt. For there, not twenty feet
distant, from an open doorway, a bright light was
streaming out into the fog.</p>

<p>For the moment we were sheltered somewhat from the
wind by the building itself, and I thought that in between
the gusts I could distinguish the sound of voices.
Though this was the very thing we had expected to
encounter, yet so long had our eyes been accustomed to
the darkness, that it came even now as somewhat of a surprise
to us and we stood staring stupidly before us.
Moreover, the light from whatever source it came did
not burn steadily, but every now and then it was
partially obscured, as if some one or something came between
it and the doorway, to burst forth a moment later
with renewed brilliance, flinging its yellow aureole of
light upon the fog, and serving but to increase the impenetrable
shadow that lay beyond. I came to myself
with a start and slowly unsheathed my sword; and I
heard a faint tinkle of steel go rippling into the darkness
behind me as the troopers did the same. Then, with the
sergeant at my side, I stole quietly forward, and halting
at the edge of the circle of light, ourselves unseen in the
shadow, we peered into the room.</p>

<p>At first I could see nothing, but as my eyes grew
accustomed to the brightness within, I was enabled to
make out the interior. It was a stable, and by the light<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
of a couple of lanterns hung upon the wall an old man
was whisping the mud stains from a magnificent chestnut
mare, pausing every now and again to rub her sleek,
glossy sides. A younger man muffled in a cloak was
standing with his back to us, a lantern at his feet.</p>

<p>My eyes were rivetted upon the mare, for I have ever
been a lover of horses, and indeed to a man who has
spent the better part of twenty years in the saddle and
who has owed his life again and again to the speed of the
animal beneath him, the love of them becomes as it were
a second nature. I saw that this was an animal rarely
met with in a thousand and that it carried a lady’s saddle
and bore the signs of recent hard riding.</p>

<p>I started when the sergeant touched my arm and
pointed to the younger man’s belt. Following the direction
of his outstretched hand, I saw that this man’s cloak
had fallen open and that he carried a bunch of keys at his
side. By this I judged him, and rightly so, as it proved,
to be the steward. This was a stroke of unexpected good
fortune, for the means of gaining access to the house
now lay to our hands.</p>

<p>It was this latter who was speaking, every word coming
plainly to our ears through the open door.</p>

<p>“Hast nearly finished?” he said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Finished?” said the other, in a high-pitched, querulous
voice, and I saw he raised his head and disclosed a
yellow face seamed with a hundred wrinkles, that he was
much older than I had first thought, and with the unmistakable
look of a man who has spent his life amongst
horses. “How should I be finished—and look at Carola!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Been down on her knees, she has! But what does my
lady care? She can stop in the light and warmth yonder.
’Tis old Reuben must clean her horse. Let old
Reuben go out in the wet and fog. Nobody minds
what happens to him!” He broke off in a fit of
coughing.</p>

<p>“How now, old grumbler!” said the other sharply.
“That is a lie, and you know it! Aye, and if my lady
heard you she would make you smart for those words!”</p>

<p>The old man looked up with a grin that disclosed the
few yellow stumps remaining in his head. “She would
that, lad!” he chuckled. The steward nodded gravely.</p>

<p>“You will find that my lady does not forget a service,”
he said slowly.</p>

<p>“God bless her!” said the old man softly, stooping once
more to his work.</p>

<p>“Amen to that,” the steward answered.</p>

<p>So that for the first time my curiosity was aroused as
to what manner of woman this could be of whom they
spoke in such terms.</p>

<p>“Aye, it will be a bad day for us all if she should marry
this Frenchman,” he continued, shaking his head.</p>

<p>“The devil take all Frenchmen!” the old man burst
out in his thin, quavering voice, and with true insular
prejudice. “She will wed a man—a man, I tell thee—not
a tricked-out, scented popinjay. Frenchman indeed,”
he continued with fine contempt. “Mark my words, lad!
Eight and sixty year I’ve lived here, boy and man, and
I’ve never seen a Frenchman yet that was a man! It’s
not in ’em, lad! It’s not born in ’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“I misdoubt you have seen one at all before, old
Reuben!” answered the other, but the old man only
continued to nod and mutter to himself. “But every
one to their taste,” the steward added. “My lady will
make a good match, and a good wife.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” the man Reuben answered, “when she is tamed,
lad; when she is tamed—and Lord help the tamer!” he
added with a chuckle that trailed off into a fit of coughing.
The steward waited until he had recovered his
breath, then:</p>

<p>“There be some at the house yonder who think ’tis Mistress
Grace he would be wedding,” he said slowly, but the
old man only shook his head.</p>

<p>“It’s not my lady,” he answered doggedly. “I’ll take
my oath of that! No, nor Mistress Grace either.”</p>

<p>“Then why is he here?” cried the steward eagerly.
“Tell me that!” The other raised his head with a cunning
look on his wrinkled face.</p>

<p>“I have heard it said that James Stuart is in Ireland,”
he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Bah!” the man in the cloak answered. “Every one
knows that!”</p>

<p>“Hark to that now!” the old man replied, apostrophising
the mare, that by way of answer whinnied softly
and laid her head upon his shoulder. “Every one knows
that! Every one knows——” He broke off with a half
inaudible chuckle.</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis true, is it not, old dotard?” said the other
sharply.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” answered the old man querulously.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
“Reuben the dotard! Reuben the fool!” and
again he laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>“Mark you,” said the steward quickly, “I love not
Dutch William. I am for the Stuarts, I! But this I
say, that James is no fighter, and if he should give
battle to William—pho!” And he snapped his fingers
expressively.</p>

<p>“Aye, if he should!” the other replied significantly.
“But—” and he sank his voice slightly—“what if he
were to slip away and leave this Dutch hog in Ireland!
What if he were to land here?”</p>

<p>“Here?” the steward cried in a startled tone.</p>

<p>“Here!” the old man went on triumphantly, “and the
Earl with him! Why, at the master’s call we’d have the
whole countryside in arms!”</p>

<p>“Aye, but what has the Frenchman to do with it?” the
other cried in a tone of bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Nay, how should I know!” he replied, grinning.
“Reuben the dotard! Only, did ever a Stuart have
money!” he added softly, with a glance of contempt at
the man before him.</p>

<p>A light seemed to break upon the steward. “Ha, I
see!” he cried excitedly. “Then you think——”</p>

<p>“I think that the mare is listening,” said the old man
with a sour smile, and he stooped to continue his task.
Nor for all the steward’s entreaties would he again
open his mouth. He gave up the attempt at length.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said reluctantly, “I may not bide here
longer. Do you make haste, and we will talk of this
again.” He stooped and raised the lantern from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
floor, and with this swaying in his hand he came toward
the open doorway to walk into our arms.</p>

<p>When the sergeant had clapped a pistol to his head
there was no more surprised a man in all England. He
could not be expected to know the fact that the wet had
long since rendered the weapon useless. As for the old
man, he stood rigid, as if petrified, with open mouth and
staring eyes, and I saw that we had nothing to fear from
him. I turned therefore to the younger man, who stood
in the sergeant’s grip, the very picture of astonishment.
Behind us the troopers crowded into the room.</p>

<p>“Now, my friend,” I said quietly, picking up the lantern
from the ground—it had fallen from his hand—“I
desire a word with you!”</p>

<p>“Who are you, and what do you want?” he stammered,
when at last he found his tongue. That soldiers should
rise up out of the night in the very centre of his master’s
lands was a thing apparently beyond his power to grasp.
He was a man of about forty, as near as I could judge,
and he bore the look of one to whom good living came
habitual. I did not anticipate having much trouble
with him, but in this I proved to be mistaken.</p>

<p>“As to who I am,” I answered sharply, “I am a king’s
officer; let that be sufficient for you! And for the rest, I
have need of your assistance, and also some information.
You are, I take it, steward to the Earl of Ingram, who,
I understand, is at present with the man James Stuart in
Ireland, and high in his favour?”</p>

<p>He looked at me, scowling, but he did not speak.</p>

<p>“Answer, will you!” cried the sergeant, thrusting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
his scarred visage within a foot of the other’s
head.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied sullenly, shrinking from the sergeant’s
fierce face.</p>

<p>“Good,” I answered. “I see that we shall get on, my
friend. You were speaking a while ago of a Frenchman.
Nay, do not give yourself the trouble of denying it. He
is still here?”</p>

<p>“And if so, what then?” he said suspiciously, heedless
of the sergeant’s threatening look.</p>

<p>“Only that I desire speech of this same gentleman,” I
answered, “and I have ridden far to get it. In the first
place, how many servants are there in the house yonder?”</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment, then:</p>

<p>“There are but a dozen,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Are you sure there are no more?” I said sharply.
“The truth, man!”</p>

<p>“I have told you,” he answered sulkily; “and the half
of these are women.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” I answered; “that is sufficient. You will
now lead us to the house, and—for I see that you have the
keys—you will show us how best to gain an entrance.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not do it,” he burst out on a sudden, to my astonishment,
for I had not given the man credit for so much
courage. “I tell you I will take no part in it! I will
do nothing that shall injure my ladies!”</p>

<p>“You are a fool!” I said tartly, for I was fast losing
patience. Time was passing, and I was anxious to get
the business over in order to dry my wet clothes, which
clung to me with a chilly persistency. Moreover, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
thought it more than probable that Cornet Graham would
have already arrived ere this at the house, and, believing
that some accident had surely befallen us, would proceed
to execute his commission in his own way. In that case
I had missed what credit there might be attached to the
actual capture. “I have told you that it is with this
gentleman I wish to speak. I have nothing to do with
aught else.”</p>

<p>“Yet I will not do it,” he said doggedly. “You may
find the key for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps the flame of yon candle across his wrists
would make him alter his mind,” growled the sergeant.</p>

<p>I saw the man turn white at the words, but he uttered
no sound. “Hark you, fellow!” I said harshly. “I have
no time to waste in trifling. I will give you till I count
ten to say if you will do as I desire, and I should recommend
you to reconsider your decision, otherwise——”</p>

<p>I caught the sergeant’s eye. He grinned and commenced
to unwind his sash. In the dead silence that followed,
a silence broken only by the whistling of the wind
without, that set the lanterns flickering and the shadows
dancing on the walls, I began slowly to count. The
troopers stood around, leaning on their swords, in keen
expectation of that which was to come.</p>

<p>It was a strange scene upon which the lantern light fell.
The mare regarding the intruders with a mild surprise,
the prisoner in the centre, silent and sullen, and lastly,
the ring of ruthless faces, upon which were stamped all
the baser passions of cruelty and lust.</p>

<p>“Eight, nine”—I made a longer pause—“ten!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The man before me had neither moved nor spoken as
yet, but now he broke out again:</p>

<p>“I will not do it! You may flog me first! I will say no
more!”</p>

<p>The sergeant’s eye had been busy searching the room.</p>

<p>“We shall not flog you,” he said grimly. “Make your
mind easy as to that. But,” he continued, “there is a
hook above, I see, and a strong one. Here, one of you,
bring me that rope yonder. I will teach him how we
unloose tongues in Tangiers!”</p>

<p>The words seemed to arouse the steward to a sense of his
danger, for he made an unexpected dash for the door.
But the troopers were too quick for him. There was a
short struggle, a volley of curses as the man was borne
down and his arms pinioned behind his back. A trooper
climbed upon the stall and flung the rope over the hook
in the ceiling. A couple more dragged their prisoner
across, and making a running noose, slipped it over his
head, and three pairs of willing hands seized the other
end of the rope, and the thing was done with a celerity of
dispatch that bespoke long practice. They but awaited
my signal. I was loth to give this, for I would have
spared the man if I could, but I saw no other way to make
him speak. I was about to give it, therefore, when there
came an unexpected interruption. Up till now the old
man I have before mentioned had stood a still and silent
spectator of the scene being enacted, but seeing his companion
standing with the rope round his neck, and reading
for the first time the doom in store for him, he suddenly
moved forward, striving to push his way to his
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“You devils!” he cried shrilly, “let the man go! Let
him go, I say!”</p>

<p>“To your kennel, old Beelzebub!” cried a trooper
roughly with a blow on the mouth that sent him reeling
backwards, to fall beneath the horse’s feet, where he lay
whimpering senilely among the straw.</p>

<p>I turned again to the prisoner.</p>

<p>“Once more,” I said shortly, “will you lead and gain
us an entrance to the house—yes or no?”</p>

<p>His white lips quivered for answer, but no sound
escaped them. He seemed like one dazed.</p>

<p>The sergeant looked inquiringly across at me. I nodded
grimly and stepped through the open door. I was desirous
of ascertaining if the fog had lifted, and there
are some things it is better not to see. It was intensely
dark outside the circle of light thrown by the lanterns,
yet after standing for a short time probing the blackness
with my eyes I thought that the mist had certainly grown
somewhat thinner, for I could dimly make out the form of
the bushes opposite me and the pathway at my feet running
into the gloom. I made my way a short distance
along this, keeping in touch with the wall upon my right.
The rain was still falling heavily, and the wind moaned
in the treetops above with a sound like the wailing of lost
souls in pain. From the room behind me came one cry
that pierced the fog and reached my ears above the gale,
and then silence.</p>

<p>The sergeant was a persuasive man. It was in less
than five minutes that, looking back, I saw his figure
appear in the doorway. Shading his eyes with his hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
he stood peering out into the darkness. I slowly retraced
my steps.</p>

<p>It was not until I was at his side that he saw me. He
gave a start at my sudden appearance; and held out his
hand. “Here is the key,” he said with a grin; “and he
has changed his mind.” I took the key and followed him
into the room.</p>

<p>The steward lay upon the ground with blackened face
and distorted features. They had taken the rope from
round his neck and it now hung dangling from the hook
above. He had the appearance of a man in the last
extremity.</p>

<p>“You have gone too far,” I said, frowning. “The man
is dying!”</p>

<p>“Not he,” the sergeant answered. “We did but give
him an extra dance on air in case the way should slip his
memory.”</p>

<p>He stooped as he spoke, and lifting the man’s body,
propped him with his back against the stall; and picking
up the bucket that lay beside the mare, he flung the
contents upon his head. It had the desired effect. In
less than five minutes the shadow faded from his face,
his breathing grew more regular. Presently they raised
him to his feet and—supported by a trooper on either
side—he stood breathing heavily.</p>

<p>“Will you guide us now?” said the sergeant fiercely, “or
must we string you up again?”</p>

<p>The man before us gave a slight gesture of assent. He
was too far gone to speak.</p>

<p>“And play us no tricks,” the sergeant growled. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
have made better men speak than you, though they were
heathen—aye, and be silent too!” And he passed his
hand across his throat with a gesture there was no mistaking.</p>

<p>I waited a few minutes longer for the knave to recover
himself and while they bound the old man to the head
of the stall, where he stood mumbling incoherent curses;
and then, thrusting the lantern into the steward’s shaking
hand, guarded by the troopers on either side, we set out
on our way. I had thought that the house lay close at
hand, but this was not the case. Now that we were in
the open air, the cold wind and the rain beating upon his
bare head had a reviving effect upon the steward, and
he led us unfalteringly through the darkness. He
turned sharply to the right; and by the flickering light
cast by the lantern, I could see that we were upon a
broad gravel walk and that the trees on either side had
given place to well-kept lawns and beds of flowers, over
which the wind swept boisterously.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lantern swung to the left; and a moment
or two later the sergeant rapped out an oath.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” I said sharply.</p>

<p>“We have left the path!” he cried.</p>

<p>I snatched the lantern from the steward’s hand and saw
that the sergeant had spoken the truth. There was turf
beneath our feet. A sudden suspicion of our guide
crossed my brain. What if he should lead us once more
to the brink of the cliff, and, true in his loyalty to the
house he served, should cause us to perish, though the act
should involve his own destruction. Such things had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
been done, I knew, and he had proved himself
to be a stubborn man. I threw the light upon his
face.</p>

<p>“What is this?” I said harshly. “Are you playing us
false, man?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered sullenly. “There should be a fountain
here.”</p>

<p>I bade the troopers keep behind me, and throwing the
light upon the ground, moved slowly forwards, half expecting
at each step to see some horrible abyss yawning
at my feet. But nothing appeared until some fifty feet
further I came once more to a gravel path, in the centre
of which a white marble fountain loomed ghost-like
through the fog. At a short distance from this stood
a stone seat, its surface strewn with the petals of withered
roses. I thrust the light back into the steward’s
hand, and he struck off into a broader walk than any we
had as yet traversed and which ascended, by means of
three or four stone steps, in a succession of terraces,
until, when we had travelled fully a quarter of a mile
from where we started, we came at last to a little stone
bridge spanning a narrow moat. I held the lantern over
this and the light shone upon the dark surface below,
covered, for the most part, with a thick growth of water-weed.
The bridge gave entrance to a broader terrace
beyond, across which loomed the dark outline of the
house. I bade them now put out the lantern; and we
crossed the terrace and stood beneath the walk of the
building. To left and right of where we were standing
the house stretched into the fog, dark and silent. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
was something almost sinister in its gloomy aspect,
matching well with the black night without.</p>

<p>Stay; a little to our right I thought that I could see
a shaft of light, and it was towards this that the steward
directed his steps. It came from a heavily curtained
window and lay a mere slit upon the gravel surface of
the terrace. At the top the curtains had fallen somewhat
apart, disclosing nothing to our view, however, beyond
a glimpse of the brightly illumined ceiling of the room.
I halted and put my lips to the steward’s ear. “What
room is that?” I said softly.</p>

<p>“It is the dining hall,” he whispered in reply. “The
man you seek is there.”</p>

<p>I noticed that the window was such as I had seen in
France. It reached to the ground and opened upon the
terrace. I left two troopers therefore to guard it, impressing
them with the necessity of using the utmost vigilance.
They took up their station one on either side,
and we continued our way until the steward stopped at
length before an arched doorway in the wall. I halted
then, and waiting till a lull in the gale, raised my voice
and gave the signal I had agreed upon with Cornet Graham.
The melancholy cry went pealing into the night,
and we stood in the darkness, straining our ears for a
reply. But no answering cry came back to them, no
sound from the silent house, save the patter of the rain
upon the ivy-covered wall and the sobbing of the wind
in its eaves and gables.</p>

<p>I waited no longer, therefore, but inserted the key in
the lock before me. It was a massive door, nail-studded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
and it opened with a sullen creak as we quickly entered,
carrying with us a breath of the fog and a shower of
raindrops. We closed it quietly behind us, and so thick
was its massive timber that the noise of the wind without
came to our ears but faintly as from a distance. We
stood in a narrow passage, giving place to a square,
dimly lit hall, from which five or six doors opened. So
far we had seen no one, but from a corridor on the right
came the sound of voices with now and again a snatch of
song.</p>

<p>I looked inquiringly at the steward.</p>

<p>“The servants’ quarters,” he whispered in return.</p>

<p>I signed to two or three of the men to take their stand
at the head of this passage, and, with the others at my
heels, crossed the hall to a door upon the left, from beneath
which the light was shining. Then, sword in hand,
I softly opened the door and we entered the room.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>OF THE KING’S ERRAND AND MY LADY’S WELCOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> interior was brilliantly lighted by a number of wax
candles set in sconces against the walls, their light
reflected by a cunning arrangement of broad mirrors
that hung upon the deep oak-panelled surface behind
them. Between these the light fell upon many a portrait
of past earls of Cleeve, interspersed with arms of
various countries and the trophies of the chase. Upon
our right, three broad stairs, flanked on either side by a
richly carved balustrade, led up to a little landing, on
which, directly facing the steps, were a pair of folding
doors. From this landing the stairway divided, ascending
left and right to a gallery overhead, that ran along
the whole length of that side of the hall. On our left
were three or four heavily curtained windows. For the
rest, the squares of bright-hued carpet lying on the
polished oaken floor, the richness of the furniture and
hangings, all bespoke the wealth of the owners, as the
cut-glass bowls filled with the summer’s flowers, the open
spinet upon which some leaves of music were scattered,
denoted unmistakably the presence of women—and
women of refinement and taste.</p>

<p>All this I took in, as it were, at a glance ere fixing
my eyes upon the two persons who occupied the
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>At the farther end, before a wide, stone chimney, in
which a bright fire of logs was burning, a lady was
seated in a high-backed chair, over which a tall man
was leaning, conversing with her in low tones.</p>

<p>Their backs were towards us, and they did not move
when I opened the door. Doubtless they thought it
was some servant who entered. They were speedily undeceived.</p>

<p>“M. de Launay,” I cried clearly, “I arrest you in the
name of his Majesty, William III.!”</p>

<p>Had a cannon-ball fallen suddenly into the room, it
could not have occasioned a greater surprise.</p>

<p>The lady started to her feet with a low cry of fear, and
so stood, gazing at us with startled eyes. As for the
gentleman, he turned to face us, his sword half drawn
from its sheath. But a second glance must have convinced
him of the futility of resistance, for he let his
hand fall to his side again. He was a handsome man
in the prime of life, and was dressed in the latest fashion
of the French Court. His suit of white flowered satin
and gold-embroidered vest became him wonderfully; his
peruke was of the largest, his cravat and the ruffles at
his wrist of the finest lace; and there was an air of graceful
elegance about him which birth and breeding alone
give. He bore the look of one who had spent his life in
the society of great men.</p>

<p>For a few seconds there was silence in the room,
broken only by the howl of the wind without and the
lashing of the rain against the window.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded, when at length he found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
his voice. He spoke English well enough, though with
a somewhat foreign accent.</p>

<p>“Permit me to explain,” I answered, turning to the
lady, though still keeping a watchful eye upon the man
before me. I now had leisure to observe her more closely.
She was young, not more than twenty years of age,
as I judged, and her gown of pink brocade served to
display the slimness of her figure. A fair face, surrounded
by its mass of flaxen curls, but one scarcely deserving
the high praises that Cornet Graham had sung
in my ears upon the road. As the thought of them recurred
to me, I could barely repress a smile. I had seen
many women more beautiful. “Do I address the Lady
Lettice Ingram?” I said, doffing my hat.</p>

<p>“She is my sister,” she replied slowly. Her eyes were
still dark with fear. In a moment I was minded of the
steward’s words. I told myself that this was the Mistress
Grace that he had mentioned.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I made haste to answer, “I beg that you will
not be alarmed at this intrusion, which the exigencies of
my errand alone warranted. My business is with this
gentleman,” I continued, indicating the Frenchman,
who stood, one white hand laid upon the hilt of his
rapier. “M. de Launay, I am charged with your arrest
by order of Sir Richard Danvers, governor of the west
during his Majesty’s absence in Ireland.”</p>

<p>“Pest!” he said coolly. “But if I am not the person
you mention. What if you have made a mistake,
monsieur?”</p>

<p>“No mistake, M. le Marquis,” I answered firmly, “as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
I am about to prove to you. Be good enough to carry
your memory back some three years, and I think
that you cannot have forgotten one Armand de
Brissac and a certain duel in the Crown Tavern at
Barcelona!”</p>

<p>For a moment he stared at me, a look of profound
astonishment on his face.</p>

<p>“De Brissac? The Maître D’Armés?” he cried quickly.</p>

<p>“On that occasion,” I continued, “you staked somewhat
heavily upon the issue and lost.”</p>

<p>“To poor D’Epernay, who fell at Walcourt. Certainly
I remember the circumstances. But you—how is it that
you?—I do not understand.” He looked at me more intently.
“<i>Pardieu!</i>” he burst out, “I know you now! He
was the finest swordsman in the French army, and you
killed him in less than five minutes!”</p>

<p>I bowed low.</p>

<p>“That being the case, monsieur,” I answered, “I think
you will admit that I have made no mistake as to your
identity.”</p>

<p>“Readily,” he replied lightly. “And your name, monsieur?
It has escaped my memory.”</p>

<p>“Adrian Cassilis,” I answered, “at your service! Captain
in his Majesty’s Tangier Horse!”</p>

<p>“A famous regiment,” he said. “I congratulate you!
I have had the pleasure of fighting against them both in
France and Flanders.”</p>

<p>Again I bowed.</p>

<p>“Admitting then, M. Cassilis,” he continued, “that I
am the man you mention, may I be permitted to ask what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
is your purpose concerning me, and where you would
take me?”</p>

<p>“To Exeter,” I answered, “in the first place.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards?” he said quickly.</p>

<p>“Doubtless my Lord Danvers will himself inform you,”
I replied.</p>

<p>“You are discreet, monsieur!” he said, frowning. “At
least you will not refuse to inform me with what offence
I am charged?”</p>

<p>“All in good time, M. le Marquis,” I answered, shrugging
my shoulders. “Be patient, I beg of you. You
have been a soldier yourself. My duty is but to secure
your person.”</p>

<p>“But, you have some idea!” he cried impatiently. “Is
it not so? Be frank, man!”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” I answered curtly. “With the Stuart in
Ireland and a French army at Dunkirk, it needs no
long head to discover a reason for depriving so distinguished
a soldier as M. de Launay of his present
liberty.”</p>

<p>“Truly I should be flattered at my celebrity,” he answered
lightly. “But if the liberty of every one of my
countrymen at present in England is for the same reason
to be so curtailed, you will require to enlarge your
prisons, monsieur!”</p>

<p>I was about to reply to this, when——</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this outrage?”</p>

<p>The words fell clearly and suddenly upon my ears.</p>

<p>I turned in the direction from which the voice proceeded,
and I saw that the folding doors beneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
gallery were wide open, and that a woman stood at the
head of the stair.</p>

<p>She stood at the head of the stairway, in the full light
of the candles, and as my eyes rested upon her face,
the dangers and hardships of our journey, nay, the very
errand upon which we had come, and the presence of the
man at my side, all faded away, and I saw nothing but
the face of the woman before me, while in my ears rang
the words of the cornet: “She is accounted by some to be
the loveliest woman in England.” And I knew that they
had not lied.</p>

<p>She was clad in a grey-velvet riding dress, that revealed
every curve of her faultless figure, silhouetted as she was
against the semi-darkness of the corridor behind. Upon
the clustering golden hair that framed her face was set
the daintiest of three-cornered riding hats. But how to
describe her beauty I know not. Words are but poor
things at best, and how can I, a plain soldier, depict with
justice that upon which the painters and poets of Europe
have lavished the finest efforts of their genius! This
only will I say: That in the proud poise of the lovely
head, upon the haughty, glowing face, with its rich
colouring heightened by her recent ride, was stamped the
pride of birth and conscious beauty.</p>

<p>Oh, she was beautiful! A woman for the sake of whom
a man might give his life and count it less than naught.
A woman to gain whose love a man might sell his soul!</p>

<p>“I am waiting, sir!” she cried impatiently, as speechless
I stood before her, dazzled by her beauty. Her
voice was rich, if a trifle imperious; her every movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
instinct with a womanly grace. Descending the steps,
she stood facing me not ten paces distant. And I saw her
eyes—eyes of a dusky, violet hue flash ominously as
she took in the details of the scene. Doubtless, splashed
with mud as we were from head to heel, our clothes sodden
with the wet, our faces streaked with scratches
where the brambles had torn us—we must have appeared
like denizens of the Pit itself.</p>

<p>Her words recalled me to myself with a start.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I stammered—and my voice sounded hoarse
even to my own ears—“I crave your pardon for so intruding,
but—That window is guarded, M. de Launay!”
I broke off sharply.</p>

<p>He gave in at that.</p>

<p>“Pest!” he said with a shrug. “You think of everything,
monsieur! I call you to witness, however, that I
had given you no parole. Have you come out against
me with an army?”</p>

<p>“I am too old a campaigner, monsieur,” I replied
curtly, “to leave aught to chance.”</p>

<p>“Address yourself to me, sir!” my lady cried imperiously,
“and in as few words as possible.”</p>

<p>I turned to where she stood, one gauntletted hand
daintily upholding her trailing skirt. In the other she
carried a short riding whip.</p>

<p>“To be brief then, madam,” I answered, “I am charged
with an order for the arrest of M. de Launay.”</p>

<p>“M. de Launay is my guest,” she replied haughtily,
“and were he King Louis himself I would not give him
up!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_040">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_040.jpg" alt="Descending the steps, she stood facing me">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“Descending the steps, she stood facing me not ten paces

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Doubtless the smallness of our numbers encouraged her
in the thought that her servants might offer us effectual
resistance. If so, she was speedily undeceived. Even as
she spoke there came the sound of many footsteps in the
hall without, accompanied by the clank of steel, and
Cornet Graham and his troop entered the room.</p>

<p>“It appears to me, madam,” I said calmly, “that you
have no option in the matter.”</p>

<p>She looked at me for a moment as if she could not
believe her ears—as if I were less than the dirt beneath
her feet. So long had she been accustomed to have her
slightest wish obeyed, that now to have her will disputed
was an experience as novel as it was humiliating.</p>

<p>“You would use force, sir?” she cried incredulously.</p>

<p>“As to that, madam,” I replied, “my answer is written
behind me!” and I glanced significantly at the troopers.</p>

<p>“It is plainly written,” she replied quickly, with a
woman’s ready wit. “Times are indeed changed,” she
continued bitterly, “when we of the house of Ingram
must submit to the bidding of the first beggar who carries
a sword at his side! But it seems that we must obey the
ruling powers, with whom even our own servants are in
league!”</p>

<p>At this I could readily believe there was no enviable time
ahead of the steward and he must have thought so, too,
for with a sudden effort he shook off the slackened grasp
of the troopers on either side and stepped quickly forward.</p>

<p>“My lady,” he cried, “what could I do? They would
have hanged me!” and he pointed to his neck, round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
which was a purple ring where the cord had cut into the
flesh, plain to be seen by the dullest eyes, and the meaning
of which could not be mistaken.</p>

<p>For a moment my lady gazed; then she drew herself to
her full height and faced us, one hand pressed against
her bosom, as if to restrain the passion that caused her
figure to tremble and flashed from the depths of her
wondrous eyes.</p>

<p>“And was this, sir,” she cried, “this in your orders—that
you should not only break into my house, but
should also vent your savage cruelty upon my inoffensive
servants?”</p>

<p>Again I stood speechless before her, for anger served
only to increase her loveliness.</p>

<p>“Inoffensive? A damned rebel!” growled the sergeant.</p>

<p>I silenced him with a look and turned once more to the
woman before me.</p>

<p>“Pooh! madam,” I said coolly, for her words nettled
me, “the man is not seriously hurt, and my duty must be
my excuse.”</p>

<p>“Your duty!” she cried with intense scorn. “You had
not dared this outrage had my brother, the earl, been
present!”</p>

<p>“But he is not, madam,” I answered with a faint sneer.
“I believe I am correct in saying that he is not even in
England!”</p>

<p>“He is where every true and loyal gentleman should
be,” she cried boldly—“in Ireland, fighting for his
rightful sovereign, King James!”</p>

<p>I heard a low gasp escape the troopers behind me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
It might have been astonishment or of admiration at her
boldness.</p>

<p>“You are frank, madam,” I replied, “and permit me to
say it—somewhat indiscreet. But again I beg you to believe
that the duty which thus forces me into your presence
was as unsought by me as it is distasteful.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe you,” she said proudly. “And you
may spare me your apologies, sir! There is never
wanting an instrument base enough to execute any deed
of injustice!”</p>

<p>Her words stung me.</p>

<p>“Very well, madam,” I replied; “then there is nothing
further to be said. M. de Launay,” I continued, “I must
trouble you for your sword. I regret that my leniency
will not so far permit me to allow you to retain it, but
give me your parole that you will attempt no escape
upon the road and you shall ride with all freedom.
Also,” I added, “I should recommend you to bring your
cloak, monsieur. The weather is inclement.”</p>

<p>“But pardon, M. Cassilis,” he broke out, as a sudden
gust of wind shook the casements and sent the raindrops
rattling on the glass, “you do not mean to ride to Exeter
on such a night as this!”</p>

<p>“By no means,” I answered. “But there is a good inn
here, I am told. We shall be there to-night, monsieur,
and start at daybreak.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” my lady cried, “he shall stay here to-night.”</p>

<p>“That is as I choose, madam,” I answered coldly, “and
I do not choose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>I could see that to be checked, thwarted, made to feel
of no account, here in the place where by virtue of her
birth and beauty she had held undisputed sway, was
galling to her pride beyond endurance. I could see it,
I say, and I rejoiced in the knowledge.</p>

<p>“Your parole, monsieur!” I said once more, turning to
the marquis.</p>

<p>“Since I have no choice in the matter,” he answered
testily, “you have it. On the honour of a De Launay!”
he added proudly.</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>“That is sufficient, monsieur,” I replied. “But pardon
me,” I continued lightly; “you say that you have no
choice in the matter. On the contrary, there is another
alternative. I am offering you the treatment of a gentleman;
if you prefer it, however, you may go bound to a
horse like any common felon.”</p>

<p>He looked at me very sourly, but he did not speak. Instead,
he unbuckled his sword and threw it with an ill
grace upon the floor, and at a sign from me, a trooper
stepped forward and picked it up. I glanced at my
lady with, I doubt not, some of the triumph I felt showing
in my eyes. I was so completely the master of the
situation.</p>

<p>“Believe me, monsieur,” I said, “I take but the precaution
that my warrant enjoins. You may read it for
yourself if you so desire.”</p>

<p>“It is of no consequence,” he answered with a wave
of the hand.</p>

<p>“But it is of consequence to me, monsieur!” my lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
cried wrathfully. “I am the mistress of this house and
the guardian of all pertaining to its honour. Show me
this warrant, if indeed you have one!” she added, turning
suddenly upon me.</p>

<p>I sheathed my sword, and with flushed face and trembling
fingers I drew the paper from my breast and held
it out to her. But she stepped backwards with such a
look of proud disdain upon her lovely face that my
hand dropped involuntarily to my side. For a moment
she stood thus, searching my eyes and enjoying, perhaps,
my confusion, for I saw that she would not take it
from my hand; then she motioned to the steward who
stood near.</p>

<p>“Give it to me!” she said proudly.</p>

<p>He took the paper from my hand and she opened it
and glanced quickly at its contents.</p>

<p>On a sudden she broke into a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>“‘By my authority,’” she said, reading. She looked
up, her eyes aflame. “We are indeed fallen low when we
must obey the authority of such men as my Lord
Danvers!—of Sir Richard Danvers, drunkard and
libertine! That is how I treat his authority!” She tore
the paper across and across and flung the pieces at her
feet. “And now begone, sir!” she continued, pointing
imperiously to the door. “Begone! you and your red-coated
rabble!”</p>

<p>For a moment I was too astounded to speak, but I
heard a low murmur from the men behind me, and the
sound recalled me to myself.</p>

<p>“Certainly I will be going, madam,” I replied. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
could no longer stay in a house where so little respect
is paid to the king’s authority. And I am not at all
sure,” I continued slowly, “that I should be exceeding
my duty if I were to arrest you also!”</p>

<p>“Arrest me?”</p>

<p>The words sprang from her lips in a tone of blank
amazement, then she drew her queenly figure erect and
gazed at me with such a tempest of wrath and scorn
in her eyes as no words of mine can picture, and I saw
her breast heave with the passion she strove in vain to
control. I could well believe that never previously in all
her life had she been so addressed.</p>

<p>“Certainly!” I answered harshly. “You seem to
forget, madam,” I continued, pointing to the fragments
of paper that lay between us, “that you have committed
nothing short of treason in so destroying the king’s
warrant. But I have no time to waste further words
upon you!” I added rudely; for I saw how I could hurt
her pride.</p>

<p>“The king’s authority!” she cried passionately. “The
authority that sends such men as you to insult women!
I would to God my servants had been present, for they
should have flogged you, sir—flogged you from the
village, and the ragged hirelings with you!”</p>

<p>I stood hand on hip not three paces from her, and I
fixed my eyes insolently upon her lovely face.</p>

<p>“I do not doubt their willingness under your tuition,
madam,” I answered coolly, “but only their ability to
do so; for,” I continued slowly, as a coarse laugh broke
from the men behind me, “if they are no better when it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
comes to blows than King James, whom they serve, of
whose courage we have lately had an example beneath the
walls of Derry, there would be more about them of
flight than fight!”</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed at me with panting breath
and quivering nostrils; then moved by my words beyond
restraint:</p>

<p>“You liar!” she cried, and throwing into the words all
her concentrated anger, before I could guess her purpose
she raised the riding whip in her hand and struck me
heavily across the face.</p>

<p>To this day I take it to my credit that no oath escaped
my lips. A thin trickle of blood ran down my cheek.
But ere she could repeat the blow I caught her wrist
and so stood facing her while one might count a score.</p>

<p>What she read in my own eyes I know not, but in the
depths of hers I read impotent passion, scorn, and hate,
but not a trace of fear.</p>

<p>I loosened her wrist—even in my pain its soft touch
thrilled me—and I stepped backwards, wiping the warm
blood from my face.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said very quietly, “one day I will repay
you for that blow with tenfold interest!”</p>

<p>“Threats!” she answered scornfully, “and to a woman!”</p>

<p>I turned away.</p>

<p>“Monsieur,” I said to the marquis, who had stood a
silent spectator of the scene, and still speaking in the
same level tones, “if you are ready to accompany us,
we will set out.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service,” he answered, taking a cloak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
from a chair in one corner of the room and wrapping
himself in its folds. Then he advanced to the ladies
to make his adieux.</p>

<p>“Farewell, madam,” he said, bowing with courtly
grace to my lady, and raising her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>“M. de Launay,” she replied, “I can find no words to
apologise for the insult offered you in this house.”</p>

<p>“Madame,” the marquis answered gallantly, “I beg
that you will banish the episode from your memory.”</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” she said quickly. “That guest
of ours should be so served, and to be powerless to prevent
it! But say, rather, au revoir, monsieur,” she continued,
with kindling eyes, “for I, too, shall ride to
Exeter to-morrow, and will myself interview Sir Richard
Danvers on your behalf! We shall see whether the name
of Ingram does not still possess weight sufficient to annul
this outrage and to punish the perpetrators!” And she
shot a scornful glance in my direction.</p>

<p>“Very good, madam,” I answered, “only in that case
I shall ride with you. I have no desire,” I continued
with a sneer, “that my Lord Danvers should hear anything
but the truth.”</p>

<p>“Then I pray you keep behind me, sir!” she replied
haughtily. “I would not have you taken for lackey of
mine!”</p>

<p>I made no reply to this. What reply could I make?
Instead, I gave a sharp order and the troopers fell into
place, the marquis in their midst. They filed through
the open doorway with the clank of steel, and the tramp
of their footsteps died away down the hall. I waited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
until the last one had left the room and then prepared to
follow.</p>

<p>Once as I crossed the threshold I looked back, and the
light fell upon the tall figure of my lady, her sister at
her side, then the door closed upon the room and its inmates,
and passing quickly through the hall, in which a
little crowd of scared servants had gathered, I went
out into the night. Outside, at the foot of the steps leading
to the main entrance, I found the troopers waiting,
the light from the open doorway shining upon their
horses, my own amongst the number.</p>

<p>I bade one of the men give up his mount to the marquis,
and collecting the men I had stationed upon the
terrace, I climbed into the saddle, and so for the first
time I left Cleeve.</p>

<p>The fog had collected somewhat, though it was still
very dark, and the brightly lighted room from which
we had come rendered the blackness that surrounded us
more opaque.</p>

<p>For myself I was content to resign the lead to Cornet
Graham and to follow behind the others with only my
thoughts for company. And if ever there was all hell in
a man’s heart, it was in mine that night.</p>

<p>For now that I was alone, now that I had no longer to
keep up appearances, I gave way to the passion I had
so far restrained. That I—I of all men, should be
struck by a woman! And in public! As the thought
of the men in front who had been witnesses of my disgrace
recurred to me, I ground my teeth with anger
and cursed this woman who had brought me to shame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>But bitterly, bitterly should she repent the blow! Oh,
to hurt her! to humble her pride! to see her at my
feet begging for mercy—and to refuse it! I gloated
over the thought, and I swore in my heart that I would
not spare her in the hour of my triumph one throb of
the pain I was now enduring. She should drink the cup
of my revenge to the bitterest dregs; and so taken up
was I with these thoughts that it was not until I saw
the lights in the windows of the houses on either
side of me that I realised that we had reached the
village.</p>

<p>I spurred forward then and overtook the troop in front.
From the length of the street and the size of the houses
I saw that the place was larger than I had been given
to understand. Here and there, at the trampling of our
horses’ feet, windows were opened, and dark figures appeared
in the doorways, or ran out, heedless of the falling
rain, into the street. But the sight of the troopers’
swarthy faces and of the hated uniform they wore drove
them swiftly indoors again. For though it was June
of the year 1690, and Dutch William had now been two
years upon the throne, yet so great was the terror which
the “Tangier devils” had inspired throughout the West,
both in friend and foe alike, at the time of Monmouth’s
ill-fated rebellion, that Catholics though the villagers
were, they knew by past experience that these very troopers
who had fought for James at Sedgemoor and elsewhere
were now equally ready to plunder them as Papists
and Jacobites in the name of William; and behind their
barred doors there was many a one, I wot, that night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
who trembled for the loss of such goods as he possessed
and for the safety of his women folk.</p>

<p>At the end of the street the cornet turned sharply to
the right and entered a square courtyard, at the opposite
side of which stood an old-fashioned inn.</p>

<p>A blaze of light came from its windows, through one
of which could be distinguished the dark figures of the
troopers of De Brito’s party. We drew rein before the
door, and almost ere we could dismount the landlord
stood upon the steps.</p>

<p>“Welcome, gentlemen,” he said, bowing. “What is
your pleasure?”</p>

<p>He was a round-faced, portly man, with an air somewhat
above that of the keeper of a country inn. There
was a nameless something about him that told me he
had at one time been a soldier.</p>

<p>“You can find room for us to-night, I suppose?” I
answered.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied slowly, “my rooms are small, but
if a couple of lofts——”</p>

<p>“That will do for us,” the sergeant said gruffly. “Better
a board than six feet of earth on such a night.”</p>

<p>“Aye, and good liquor in plenty to soften it,” cried
a trooper, and the men laughed.</p>

<p>“You shall find no complaint with that, I promise you,”
said the landlord. “There are wines to suit all tastes,
and as for my cider, ’tis second to none in all Devonshire.”</p>

<p>“To the devil with your cider!” said a trooper roughly.
“Give us brandy, hot, and of the best, if you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
keep this hen coop from being burned round your
ears!”</p>

<p>“And a pretty wench to serve it!” cried another.</p>

<p>“As you please, gentlemen! As you please!” the landlord
hastened to say. “None should know better than
I how to treat you. I have cognac here—the best out
of France. But come inside, gentlemen, and my men
shall look to your horses.” He turned and led the way
indoors.</p>

<p>In a square, stone-paved room on the right of the passage
we found De Brito’s troopers, a plentiful supply
of ale upon the low tables before them, who greeted their
comrades with boisterous shouts of welcome.</p>

<p>“Would it not be advisable, monsieur, to seek another
apartment?” said M. de Launay. “Your men are gallant
fellows, but save on the field of battle, I prefer
them at a distance.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” I answered. “You have another
room?” I said, turning to the landlord.</p>

<p>“This way,” he replied, leading me, closely followed
by Cornet Graham and the marquis, down a narrow, low-ceilinged
passage.</p>

<p>“You have seen service yourself?” I said sharply.</p>

<p>“Aye, years ago,” he replied briefly. “I fought for
the Swede.”</p>

<p>He stopped before a door upon the left, and with
many apologies for his lack of space, ushered us into
what proved to be the kitchen of the inn. It was a large
room well stocked with articles pertaining to its character.
Here a row of brightly polished pans, there a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
score of reeves of onions, while from a hook in one corner
hung a well-cured ham.</p>

<p>Before a great fire of logs De Brito was sitting, a
leather flask and tankard upon a table at his side, to the
former of which I saw he had been paying liberal attention.
He looked up as we entered.</p>

<p>“So you’ve come at last,” he said thickly. “Landlord,
bring glasses for these gentlemen, and more brandy.
What the devil!” he broke off suddenly, catching sight
of my face. “Did the dove turn out to be a hawk, after
all? Well, she has not marred your beauty!” and he
laughed insolently.</p>

<p>But I could brook no more.</p>

<p>All the passion that was smouldering in my heart flashed
into sudden flame.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” I cried, and I caught the tankard from
the table and flung the contents in his face; then, drawing
my sword, I placed myself on guard.</p>

<p>He dashed the liquor from his eyes (it had been half
full of the raw spirit) and sprang to his feet with a
furious oath.</p>

<p>But he had reckoned without his cost. Even as he
snatched his blade from the table where he had laid it
the fumes of the brandy that he had been drinking
heavily mounted to his brain. He staggered forward,
his knees gave way under him, and he fell to the floor,
where he lay, unable to rise.</p>

<p>I sheathed my sword, and turning on my heel, left the
room. In the passage I encountered the landlord returning,
a tray of glasses in his hand. He readily agreed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
to my request to be shown some chamber where I could
sleep, and lighting a candle, he led me up a narrow flight
of stairs and stopped before a door upon the landing.</p>

<p>“It is small,” he said doubtfully, entering the room,
“and there is but room for one.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” I answered, for I wished to
be alone with my thoughts. I took the candle from his
hand, therefore, and with a few directions as to the disposal
of M. de Launay and upon other matters, I bade
him “good-night.”</p>

<p>I stood for a moment at the open door. From the
troopers below came a confused babel of oaths and
laughter, mingled with the clatter of cups. Then, closing
the door and shooting the bolt behind me, I pulled
off my coat and heavy riding boots and threw myself,
dressed as I was, upon the couch. And there for hours
I lay, planning my great revenge, whilst ever before my
eyes was my lady’s proud face as I had last seen it, alight
with scorn. It was far into the night and the noises
from the rooms below had long since died away when I
finally dropped into the sleep of utter exhaustion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>OF MY LADY’S MISSION TO EXETER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first streaks of dawn were lightening the chamber
when I awoke to a consciousness of my surroundings.
I sprang from my couch with faculties alert, for I am,
as a rule, but a light sleeper. It is a legacy that, with
others, has been bequeathed to me by many a campaign
in foreign lands, when often a man’s life might hang
upon the sharpness of his wits and his power of decision
at a moment’s notice under any circumstances.</p>

<p>I crossed the room to the window and looked out
through its tiny latticed panes.</p>

<p>Mist, mist everywhere, and so thick that I could
barely distinguish the courtyard of the inn below.</p>

<p>Ere donning my coat and boots I made shift to cleanse
them in so far as possible from the mud stains of the
previous day and to make such poor means of a toilet
as the room afforded. It was in doing this that I accidentally
caught sight of myself in a little square of
cracked glass that hung upon the wall beside the window.</p>

<p>Across my brow ran a purple weal, terminating in a
great bruise of black and yellow, where my lady’s whip
had fallen, and at sight of the discoloured flesh my
rage against her broke out anew.</p>

<p>I buckled on my sword with a grim smile. She had yet
to learn whether she could beat me like a hound with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
impunity. Downstairs in the hall I found the landlord
already up, who greeted me with a cheery “good-morning.”</p>

<p>I questioned him closely as to the road, and found, as
I expected, that the one running down the valley was the
direct road to Exeter, which lay to the north, some thirty
miles distant.</p>

<p>On my inquiring further for Cornet Graham, he led me
once more to the kitchen. Upon one side of the open fireplace
I found the cornet asleep in an old-fashioned,
leather-covered chair. On a table near, a pack of greasy
cards and a couple of empty wine flasks betokened the
means that he and the marquis had taken to while away
some portion of the night, and testified to the good
fellowship existing between them. It was not without
difficulty that I awoke the cornet sufficiently to understand
my orders. For the fatigues of the previous day,
combined with the effects of the potations he had freely
imbibed, still lay heavily upon his brain.</p>

<p>He sat up at last, his eyes dull and heavy with sleep. I
explained briefly to him my intentions, and bade him follow
with as little loss of time as possible, and I then drew
a chair to the table and sat down to a light meal that
the landlord speedily laid out for me.</p>

<p>My hunger satisfied, I rose from my seat and bade
him show me where my horse was stalled.</p>

<p>He hesitated for a moment.</p>

<p>“But my bill!” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“As to that,” I answered, “we ride upon the king’s
service, so you would do well to present it to my Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
Danvers, at Exeter. You do not think that I shall pay
it, man!” I cried sharply, as he still hesitated. And I
smiled to myself at the thought of the few broad pieces
remaining in my pocket.</p>

<p>“For that matter,” I continued significantly, “be content
that you possess a whole skin to-day. It is more
than others of your trade have lived to boast of. And
now, my horse!”</p>

<p>He muttered something under his breath, and turning
on his heel, led the way down the passage. As we passed
the main room of the inn I glanced through the open
door.</p>

<p>The tables were overturned and I saw the bodies of
three, at least, of the troopers still lying upon the floor,
amid a litter of broken glass, in a drunken slumber. The
room and passage reeked vilely with tobacco, so that it
was a relief to step out into the courtyard and breathe
the cool morning air.</p>

<p>The landlord crossed the yard, and at his call a sleepy
hostler came yawning from one of the stables. It was
but the work of a minute to slip the saddle upon the back
of my horse, and then I mounted, and with a final wave
of the hand rode out of the inn.</p>

<p>Once the village was behind me, I broke into a canter,
and the cool morning breeze, redolent of the sea, sang
past my ears. The birds were waking in the hedgerows,
filling the summer morning with their harmony; a little
stream by the wayside rippled merrily amongst the
pebbles, and every leaf and flower, sparkling with the
night’s rain, reared their heads joyously to greet the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
rays of the sun as they struggled through the mist, which
had so far dispelled that I could plainly distinguish objects
fifty feet distant.</p>

<p>There was a peacefulness brooding upon the country,
a restful repose in the quiet air, to which, fresh from the
narrow streets and reeking kennels of London, I had long
been a stranger. I became absorbed in the contemplation
of the unwonted sights around me, until a sudden
throb of pain across my brow recalled me to myself and
I fell to taking council of the anger in my heart.</p>

<p>I had ridden thus for some half mile, the roadway
slightly ascending, before I came on my right to the
gates leading to Cleeve Manor. They were wide open
and were supported on either side by massive pillars,
surmounted by a pair of couchant lions carved in stone,
and beneath these the arms of the Ingram family.</p>

<p>Within the gates a broad avenue, flanked on either side
by majestic oaks and beeches, stretched away into the
mist.</p>

<p>I drew rein at the entrance, and there I was fain to wait,
for I did not consider it likely that my lady had yet set
out, and I had determined that I would not again
approach the house in my present state, to become a mark
for the prying eyes of every serving wench.</p>

<p>It may have been the half of an hour that I waited thus,
when the sound of hoofs ringing on the gravel surface of
the avenue broke on my ear, and a minute later the horses
and their riders came into sight. There were four in
all of the latter.</p>

<p>In front, mounted upon the chestnut mare I had last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
seen in the stable, rode my lady. She was dressed in the
same grey-velvet costume she had worn the night previous
and her face was partially concealed by a riding mask
of black silk. At her side rode the steward, a loose
scarf around his neck. But my eyes were fixed upon the
third member of the party, and there remained. He
was, I think, the biggest man that I have ever seen.
Mounted though he was, the massiveness of his head and
build and the breadth of his shoulders all bespoke a man
far above the ordinary proportions. Seen through the
veil of mist, horse and man appeared gigantic. As for
the other member of the party riding by his side, he was
little more than a youth, and might have been a groom or
under stable hand.</p>

<p>I reined my horse to one side of the gateway, at the
same time pressing my hat upon my brow, for I was not
desirous that my lady should see her handiwork. Yet even
then, so great is the force of habit, that when she had
arrived opposite me my hand went instinctively to the
brim, but recollecting myself in time, I bowed low in my
saddle instead.</p>

<p>But she did not look at me.</p>

<p>With head erect, she passed me by, her servants at her
heels, and set off down the road at a brisk canter.</p>

<p>I fell into place about a dozen yards behind, and I now
had leisure to scan them more closely.</p>

<p>I saw that the three men were fully armed, not only with
a brace of pistols in their holsters, but also that each
one carried a serviceable looking rapier at his side.</p>

<p>I noticed, too, that my lady sat her steed with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
grace and ease of a born horsewoman. From time to time
she conversed shortly with the steward at her side, but
she never turned her head, and I suppose that she had
given her orders to the men behind her, for the whole
party rode without taking any notice as to whether I
followed or not. We had ridden thus for a distance of
some five miles, when my lady turned sharply to the left
along a narrow track running between the torrs. For a
moment I drew rein at the entrance, and I confess I hesitated.
The way was but wide enough to admit of riding
in single file, and I would have wished to have had
Cornet Graham and the troopers at my heels. But in a
moment I pulled myself together. After all, what had I
to fear, or what benefit would it be to M. de Launay
should they see fit to attack me? Tush! that I, the best
sword in the low countries, should be afraid of three
assailants, even though one proved to be a giant.</p>

<p>I loosened my sword in its sheath, saw that my pistols
were to my hand, and spurred after the party in front.
They should not find me unprepared if it came to blows.</p>

<p>On either side of the track rose the bare hillside, shutting
out the view of what lay beyond. A more desolate
path, extending as it did for more than a mile, could
hardly be imagined. But my lady held on her way without
faltering, and presently the track came out upon the
road again, and I saw that we had but taken a short cut,
and so saved ourselves several miles.</p>

<p>Of the rest of our journey to Exeter one incident only
stands out in my memory. It was at noon, and the mist
had long since vanished from the face of the country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
giving place to a sky of cloudless blue and the shimmering
heat of the midday sun. We had reached a little
village, the name of which I have long since forgotten,
and halted at the quaint, old-fashioned inn, above the
doorway of which ran an inscription informing the world
that it was built by one Robert Havell in the year 1542,
“Who mayde a journie to London.” Doubtless no mean
undertaking in those days.</p>

<p>And here my lady dismounted and entered the one
parlour the inn could boast of. But as for me, I was
content to seat myself upon a bench against the wall
without, where I could keep an eye upon her servants,
for I thought it not unlikely that they might tamper
with my horse, to which a youth was now attending. If
they had any such intention in their minds, however, my
resolute attitude and the sight of the pistols I had placed
ostentatiously at my side must have deterred them from
making the attempt, for they seated themselves at some
little distance and fell to upon the food which the landlord
presently placed before us, occasionally varying this
performance by staring at me, the steward with menacing
hate, and the big man with a lowering gaze that
showed me how willingly they would have attempted to
have rid themselves of me but for my lady’s presence.</p>

<p>It was to the latter of the two men that the landlord
paid most attention, waiting upon him with a deference
that his station seemed scarcely to warrant. Accordingly,
when I had finished, I rose from my seat, and
beckoning the landlord on one side, demanded who the
man was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>He looked at me in undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>“What?” he cried. “You do not know him? I thought
that every one knew Sampson Dare!”</p>

<p>I knew the man then. It was a name to conjure with
throughout all Devon. For this was the champion
wrestler of the West, whose fame had reached even as far
as London itself, where he had twice appeared to show
his skill before the late king, and accounted generally to
be the strongest man in England. I knew, also, that
should ever I come to close quarters with such a man my
strength would be of as little more value to me than that
of a child.</p>

<p>Presently my lady came forth again, and the horses
were led round to the door, and here it was that the
incident I have mentioned occurred.</p>

<p>In mounting my steed I had the misfortune to loosen
my hat, which fell off and rolled at the others’ feet.</p>

<p>“My hat, fellow,” I cried sharply to the youth
whom I had taken to be a groom, and who was nearest
to it.</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment, but he did not offer to
stoop.</p>

<p>“I am not your man,” he answered insolently. “Pick
it up for yourself. You will need it to shield your
face,” he added with a grin.</p>

<p>I flung a curse at him, but there was no other help for
it but to do as he said, for the landlord had gone indoors.
I was compelled to dismount, therefore, and it needed but
the light contemptuous laugh that came from my lady’s
lips to inflame afresh my anger against her, which grew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
steadily with every hour that we rode beneath the burning
summer sun.</p>

<p>We crossed the Teign above Newton Abbott, and continued
our way by means of the old Roman Road up the
beautiful valley of the Exe. The sun was low down in the
west and the shadows were lengthening on the grass
when the massive towers of the cathedral at Exeter came
into sight, and beneath them the smoke cloud that hung
above the city in the still evening air. We crossed the
bridge over the river and entered the gates, and at the
commencement of the High Street I left the others to
ride forward, and turning my horse into a side thoroughfare,
made my way along the less crowded streets to a
large house standing in a quiet square not far distant
from the cathedral, for I knew that it was here, if anywhere,
that I should find my Lord Danvers. The house
itself was inhabited by one Mistress Maddon, who had at
one time been upon the stage, but who, having married
from thence a wealthy merchant of the city of London,
had in the course of a few years reduced him to the
verge of ruin by her extravagance. Upon this she had
fled incontinently with Sir Richard Danvers, and had
come to Exeter two years previously, where she flaunted
it before the town, to the no small scandal of the city
dignitaries and their ladies. Nay, the scandal was notorious
throughout the West.</p>

<p>I dismounted before the house, and flinging my reins to
a beggar loitering near, ascended the steps.</p>

<p>The door was opened by a gorgeously dressed lackey
in a livery of scarlet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>“Sir Richard Danvers is here?” I said sharply.</p>

<p>He stared superciliously at my travel-stained appearance.</p>

<p>“My lord is indeed present,” he replied loftily, “but
his hours for transacting business are over for the day.”
And he made as though to shut the door in my face.</p>

<p>But I was too quick for him. With a thrust of my
foot I sent it open again and stepped quickly past him
into the hall.</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” I said coolly. “My business is too
urgent to admit of further delay, and you can so tell
your master.”</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment with an air of outraged
dignity.</p>

<p>“Impossible that you can be admitted,” he said stiffly.
“His lordship is dining.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I must see him,” I answered grimly.
“And I am on the king’s service, my friend. It occurs
to me, therefore, that you will do well to announce me
without further waste of time if you would save yourself
present trouble.”</p>

<p>I suppose that there was a look in my eyes that showed
him I was not a man to be trifled with, for without more
ado he noiselessly crossed the hall and ushered me into
a richly furnished room, where he left me to my own
devices.</p>

<p>I have said that the apartment was richly furnished,
but a second scrutiny convinced me of the error of my
first impression. The light of the setting sun flaming
through the windows fell upon the heavy gilt furniture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and mirrors, the Oriental carpets and hangings, serving
but to increase their appearance of general gaudiness.
There was that, indeed, about the whole which bespoke
a certain amount of wealth, but of wealth coupled with
ill taste. I contrasted the room with that other one at
Cleeve which I had so lately left, and it was to the latter’s
distinct advantage. For the rest, opposite me was a door,
half concealed by a thick curtain, and near the hearth
stood a small table littered with papers, and upon which
lay a man’s hat and riding gloves. It may have been
ten minutes that I waited thus impatiently, keeping an
eye upon the street without, ere the door behind me
opened and a woman entered the room.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to assure me that this was the
Mistress Maddon, and she was well in keeping, both in
dress and appearance, with her surroundings.</p>

<p>Doubtless she had at one time been handsome in a bold,
masculine way, but she was now past her prime, and
the resources of art could not conceal the ravages of
time. Nay, if anything, they tended rather to increase
them. On a sudden a vision of my lady rose before my
eyes, and I gazed on the smirking, beruddled face of the
woman before me with a sense of deepening disgust.</p>

<p>She was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p>“You wish to see Sir Richard Danvers?” she said, advancing.</p>

<p>“Such is my desire, madam,” I answered, bowing.</p>

<p>“And one which I fear cannot be gratified,” she replied,
“for ’tis his Lordship’s invariable custom to sleep after
dining.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>In spite of her smooth words, I was not satisfied, for
my eyes, travelling past her, happened to rest upon the
curtain which covered the other doorway, and I saw it
move.</p>

<p>Decidedly, the door behind it had been opened. Accordingly
I raised my voice.</p>

<p>“Then I pray you to awake him, madam,” I answered,
“for the business I have to discharge is urgent.”</p>

<p>“What is your business?” she said sharply.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I answered coolly, “I regret that it is for
his ears alone.”</p>

<p>She bit her lip with vexation.</p>

<p>“Or, to be plain, sir,” she replied, “you will not tell
me?” and she tapped her foot impatiently upon the
floor.</p>

<p>“If you so put it, madam,” I said bluntly.</p>

<p>She looked at me with a gathering frown. “You need
not fear to trust me, sir,” she answered quickly. “My
lord has no secrets that I do not share.”</p>

<p>“But I am not his lordship,” I retorted with a faint
sneer. “Therefore I pray you to hold me excused,
especially as it is connected with affairs of state.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ’tis upon a matter of state you come?” she cried
in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“If a document signed by the Privy Council itself can
be rightly so termed, madam,” I answered dryly.</p>

<p>“Then you are not Colonel Overton?” she said hastily.</p>

<p>I looked at her in unfeigned astonishment. I suppose
she saw the answer written on my face.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see that you are not,” she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“I am certainly not Colonel Overton,” I replied, at a
loss for her meaning.</p>

<p>“Nor come on his behalf?” she persisted.</p>

<p>“So little, madam,” I answered, “that I do not even
know the name of the gentleman you mention.”</p>

<p>To my surprise she gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“Had you given us your name and the nature of your
business at first, sir, you might have saved yourself
this delay,” she said abruptly. Then raising her
voice:</p>

<p>“You can come in, my lord,” she cried. “It is not
Colonel Overton.”</p>

<p>At this the curtain was drawn aside, and a man whom
I recognised from description to be Sir Richard Danvers
himself entered the room. I looked at him with some curiosity.
There was little remaining of the grace of manner
and personal beauty that in his younger days had made
him a companion of the gay and witty Charles II. of that
name, as his total unscrupulousness had equally endeared
him to the late king. In age he was at this time nearing
fifty, and his clean-shaven face bore the traces of a
career of dissipation. His cravat was loosened, and I
noticed the stain of wine upon his velvet coat.</p>

<p>He came forward with a somewhat shamefaced air.</p>

<p>“Curse me!” he cried, “I am glad of it. It would
seem that there is some mistake. I owe you a thousand
apologies, sir, for keeping you waiting. ’Tis the fault
of the blockhead who admitted you. I took you for a
gentleman to whom I lost somewhat heavily at cards
last evening. You will understand it is not always convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
to pay. But I do not think that I have your
name?”</p>

<p>“I am Captain Cassilis, of the Tangier Horse,” I
answered.</p>

<p>He looked at me, frowning; then, with a sudden interest
in his heavy eyes:</p>

<p>“Cassilis? Cassilis, the swordsman?” he cried.</p>

<p>I bowed low in acknowledgment. It seemed that my
reputation had preceded me.</p>

<p>“If you will remember, my lord,” I continued, “I was
charged yesterday with the arrest of the Marquis de
Launay, at Cleeve.”</p>

<p>“I did indeed sign a document to that effect,” he replied,
“but I was unaware that you were the officer to
whom the task was entrusted.”</p>

<p>He drew a chair to the table, scattering the papers
from the latter with a sweep of his hand.</p>

<p>“Proceed, sir,” he continued brusquely. “You succeeded
in arresting this gentleman?”</p>

<p>“He should be in Exeter to-night, my lord,” I answered;
“and——”</p>

<p>“One moment, captain,” he interrupted. “Pardon me
my forgetfulness. You have had a long ride and a
dusty one. Let us have wine, Nell, for talking is
cursedly thirsty work, and of business, thirstier!”</p>

<p>“Not for me, my lord,” I said hastily; “my errand——”</p>

<p>“Can wait,” he answered. “Tush, man! You will talk
all the readier. I have wine here that would unloose any
tongue.” And he threw himself back in his chair.</p>

<p>I cursed him inwardly for the delay, for at this moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
I distinctly caught the faint clatter of horses’ hoofs in
the street below. I was obliged to wait, however, until
the woman had brought a bottle and glasses from a
carved oaken cabinet and placed them upon the table
before him. My lord filled the glasses with a slightly
trembling hand.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he said, “this is wine of the best, captain.
None of your light French wines, this! I bought it of
Rochester himself. And damn me! I should know a good
wine when I see one. None better.”</p>

<p>I looked at the face of the man before me, and in my
own mind I fully coincided with his opinion.</p>

<p>“I drink to the success of your mission, sir,” he continued.</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” I answered.</p>

<p>He drained his glass at a draught, but as for me, I
was content to be more moderate, for the wine was of
the strongest.</p>

<p>“And now to your tale, captain,” he said, refilling
his glass.</p>

<p>I waited no longer, but plunged briefly into a recital
of the events of the previous day, omitting only that
portion that related to the bruise upon my forehead.
Once Mistress Maddon interrupted me.</p>

<p>“And this Lady Ingram,” she said contemptuously,
“you have seen her? Is she as beautiful as they say?”</p>

<p>“She is very beautiful, madam,” I answered quietly.</p>

<p>Despite my hatred of her, I could be no less than candid.
Once, too, when I came to the account of how she had
served the royal warrant, my lord swore a great oath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and half rose from his seat; but he sank back again and
did not interrupt me. In the momentary silence that
followed the conclusion of my story I caught the sound
of voices in the hall without; nay, I even thought that I
could distinguish my lady’s imperious tones.</p>

<p>Suddenly my lord leaned forward.</p>

<p>“But there was resistance?” he said, scanning my face.</p>

<p>I felt my brow burn.</p>

<p>“Nothing of any consequence, my lord,” I answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Ha!” he cried; “I have been too lenient hitherto. And
here—here,” he continued, taking a paper from the
table before him, “is an order from the Council urging
more stringent measures. Should James succeed in Ireland,
Louis will land an army on the coast—’tis more
than likely here, in Devon. Tourville, with the French
fleet, is in the channel. Parliament is distracted. Spies
everywhere. Burn me!” he cried with sudden rage,
“they shall not complain of my remissness, and I will
begin here. I would that I had to deal with this
woman!”</p>

<p>“In that case, my lord,” I said, “your wish may be
speedily gratified, for Lady Ingram is herself in Exeter
for the express purpose of waiting upon your lordship.”</p>

<p>“Say you so?” he replied with an ugly frown. “Then
I will see her. And curse me! she shall have cause to
remember it.”</p>

<p>“But not here,” Mistress Maddon cried suddenly. “Let
her carry her complaints elsewhere—to London, if she
pleases! She shall not come here!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Shall not?” my lord cried angrily. “She shall come
here, or elsewhere, as I choose, madam! Remember, I am
master of this house—and what you are!” he added
brutally.</p>

<p>“You do well to remind me of that,” she answered
bitterly; “but she does not enter whilst I am here.”</p>

<p>“What, jealous?” my lord cried sneeringly. “Sink
me! ’tis a good jest that. The little Maddon jealous!”
And he laughed coarsely.</p>

<p>“I have so much reason to be jealous, have I not?” the
woman answered contemptuously. “Nevertheless,” she
continued, “this fine madam shall not enter the house.”</p>

<p>I caught the sound of footsteps in the hall.</p>

<p>“Then I fear in that case, madam, that you are too
late,” I said quickly.</p>

<p>She turned to me in sudden surprise.</p>

<p>“Too late? And why, sir?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Too late, madam,” I answered firmly, “for I think
that the answer is here.”</p>

<p>Even as I spoke the door was thrown wide open and
my lady stood upon the threshold.</p>

<p>It was my lady, still wearing her riding mask. Over
her shoulder I caught a glimpse of the lackey’s scared
face.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood in the doorway, and I saw
her slightly start as her eyes encountered mine; evidently
she had not expected my presence. Then she entered
the room.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say whether my lord or Mistress
Maddon was the more surprised at her appearance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
Nevertheless, it was the woman who first recovered herself.</p>

<p>“This is an unexpected honour, madam,” she said, advancing.
“The business must surely be urgent that
brings your ladyship as far as Exeter on such a day!”</p>

<p>My lady stepped back, drawing her skirts together with
a slight gesture of repulsion as cruel as it was intentional.
I saw that she was fully acquainted with the
scandal attached to this woman’s name.</p>

<p>“The business must indeed be urgent that brings me
here,” she answered scornfully.</p>

<p>“Where you come a self-invited guest,” Mistress Maddon
replied quickly. “But of course your ladyship has
been to Court, and doubtless you have been taught
manners which less favoured persons cannot hope to
imitate.”</p>

<p>“Including even a sense of shame,” my lady answered
icily.</p>

<p>I saw the woman before her redden beneath her rouge.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” she retorted sneeringly. “But perhaps your
ladyship needed to be instructed in the lesson. It does
not come readily to every one of our sex.”</p>

<p>“To some, never,” my lady replied in the same icy
tone, and I saw her eyes flash behind her mask. “But I
have had so little experience of how to treat such women!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Mistress Maddon cried, “you have a keen wit,
madam, have you not? ’Tis a pleasure to converse with
you. Will your ladyship condescend to be seated?”</p>

<p>“I prefer to stand,” my lady replied haughtily. She
turned to the man, who still sat silent at the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Sir Richard Danvers,” she cried, “I presume you have
already heard from the lips of this gentleman a version
of the story that brings me to Exeter?” and she shot a
glance replete with scorn at where I stood. “I demand
to know,” she continued proudly, “by what right do you
arrest a guest residing in my house?”</p>

<p>Her words aroused my lord.</p>

<p>“And I demand, madam, that you remove your mask!”
he replied.</p>

<p>My lady drew herself erect.</p>

<p>“Is this necessary, sir?” she said coldly.</p>

<p>“If we are to continue the conversation, madam,” my
lord answered, “I prefer that it should be face to face.”</p>

<p>“Or if you have scruples, madam,” Mistress Maddon,
who was standing near to the window, cried suddenly, “I
notice that your ladyship’s servants grow impatient.”</p>

<p>With a sudden passionate gesture my lady tore the
riding mask from her face and flung it from her.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied, sir?” she cried with flashing eyes,
in the depths of which I read all the scorn of her surroundings,
all the loathing of the people in whose presence
she was. And as I gazed at where she stood, with
the dying sunlight falling on her graceful figure and
turning the masses of her hair to burnished gold, surely,
I told myself, never had I seen so fearless a lady nor so
fair a face.</p>

<p>And could there be a greater contrast than that afforded
by the two women before me? The one so proud and
pure, so rich in all the noblest qualities endowing womanhood,
the other with the glamour of passion long since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
decayed, leaving but the barren busk of sin in its
train.</p>

<p>I glanced at my lord. As he gazed upon her beauty,
into his eyes there crept a look such as I had seen
upon men’s faces before.</p>

<p>“Of what measure of truth there was in the story told
you I do not seek to learn,” my lady continued proudly.
“But I demand the immediate release of M. de Launay
as the least reparation you can offer for the outrage committed
by this man, whose very presence in my house was
an insult, and was resented by me as such.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously I raised my hand to my forehead, but
my lady’s quick eyes noted the movement, for she turned
upon me suddenly and added: “And I think, sir, that you
will not easily conceal the mark of my resentment.”</p>

<p>I stood before her and I was dumb. That she should
mock me—and before strangers. How I hated her in
that moment! I was about to stammer something in
reply when my lord sprang to his feet and struck the
table before him with his clenched hand.</p>

<p>“Demand? Reparation?” he cried, with sudden passion.
“By G——, madam, you go too far! But I shall
know how to deal with you—as I have the authority.”
And he snatched the paper he had previously shown me
from the table.</p>

<p>“Have a care, my lord,” Mistress Maddon cried maliciously.
“Remember the fate of the other document.
It would seem that her ladyship has a predeliction for
destroying that which does not belong to her.”</p>

<p>“Ha! you are right, Nell,” my lord cried, his brow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
black with passion. “You defy the king’s authority, do
you, madam?” he continued, “and beat the king’s
officers? Well, ’tis known to us that your part of the
county is disaffected, that your house is a centre for
Jacobite meetings and a harbourage for their agents.
Were it not for urgent affairs here I would visit you
myself. As that is impossible, I will tell you what I will
do, madam. I will send such a force to Cleeve as shall
effectually quench all sparks of rebellion there. Aye, and
I will find the right man to set over it to deal with you.”</p>

<p>“And the very man you desire is here—here to your
hand!” and Mistress Maddon pointed full at me with her
fan.</p>

<p>As I thought of all the possibilities her words carried,
of the opportunities of repaying to my lady the shame
I had suffered at her hands, my heart beat more rapidly
and the breath came quicker from my lips. Here was
revenge, indeed!</p>

<p>“Sink me!” my lord cried, “but you are a clever one,
Nell. Captain Cassilis, you have no cause to love this
lady. What say you? Will you be this man? You
shall have full power over their lives—and bodies!” he
added with a leer.</p>

<p>“That I accept, my lord,” I cried quickly. “And I will
answer for it,” I continued between my set teeth and with
a glance of triumph at my lady, “that your lordship
shall have no trouble there whilst I am in command!”</p>

<p>“I am well assured of it,” he replied, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“And I—I will appeal against this outrage,” my lady
cried quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“Appeal to the—queen, an you will, madam,” he
answered rudely. “Though, distracted as she is with
fears for her husband’s safety in Ireland, I scarcely think
that she will interfere on behalf of those who are his
active enemies. To the Council! Proclaim yourself a
Papist and see what consideration you will meet with at
their hands. No, no, I give you credit for more sense,
madam,” he continued; “and I trust that you will take
this lesson to heart.”</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> trust,” Mistress Maddon cried ironically, “that
your ladyship has suffered no hurt through entering this
house! Perhaps for the future, my lady, you will learn
a little more experience of how to treat ‘<i>such women!</i>’”</p>

<p>And she swept her a mocking curtesy.</p>

<p>My lady was beaten, and she knew it.</p>

<p>In that moment I could almost have found it in my
heart to pity her. Yet she spoke no word.</p>

<p>For a moment, indeed, she stood gazing at the woman
before her with a look of unutterable scorn, then she
turned upon her heel.</p>

<p>I sprang to the door and flung it wide. “Permit me
to be your lackey, madam, for this occasion,” I cried
sneeringly, “until I can appear as <i>your master</i>—at
Cleeve!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>OF HOW THREE GENTLEMEN OF DEVON DRANK THE KING’S
HEALTH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> hour later, when I left the house, I carried in my
breast a sealed document giving me the fullest powers of
acting, both in Cleeve and the surrounding district,
against “all Papists and adherents of the man James
Stuart; being enemies of his Majesty, King William, and
of the peace of this realm.” Moreover, I had received an
order from my lord upon the treasury—which had been
duly paid me by his secretary—that had lined my
pockets with gold pieces, to defray all such disbursements
as should be necessary to bring M. de Launay to London.
For the express orders of the Privy Council were that
the marquis should be treated with all courtesy until such
time as he should be delivered into the custody of the
governor of the Tower, that grim and ill-omened
fortress, at present crowded with the partisans, real or
suspected, of the base and despicable James; amongst
the most noteworthy of whom were the Earl of Shrewsbury
and the Queen’s uncle, Clarendon.</p>

<p>Also I carried a letter from his lordship to the Earl
of Nottingham, Secretary of State, praying him to send
a regiment or two into Devonshire; for with the exception
of the Tangier Horse there were no regular troops
nearer to Exeter than Bristol or Plymouth. And even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
now, in consequence of a riot arising out of a drunken
brawl, my lord had been compelled, at the urgent demands
of the most influential citizens, to send the regiment
out of the city; whence they had marched the day
before as far as Exmouth, so great was the fear inspired
by their licentiousness.</p>

<p>I saw, therefore, that I should have little more assistance
to rely on than that of my own troop—amounting in
all to sixty men—which still lay in De Brito’s charge
at Cleeve. And with this force I had to overawe the
district and patrol the coast from Start Bay to Teignmouth.</p>

<p>Accordingly, armed with this commission for the present,
and with the prospect of revenge upon my lady in
the near future, I rode slowly through a network of
narrow alleys to the Castle and Falcon, a respectable
hostelry in the High Street; for it was here that I had
told Cornet Graham to look for me.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until fully two hours later that I
heard the tramping of horse in the street without.</p>

<p>I made my way to the door and found the landlord
already upon the steps, the landlady, a buxom woman,
at his side.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, the cornet and his prisoner. Behind
them came an escort of six troopers. The whole party
dismounted before the inn.</p>

<p>“Ha, M. Cassilis!” the marquis cried, catching sight of
me, “confess that you were growing anxious! Did you
not think that I had knocked my estimable guard upon
the head?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“When I had your word of honour, M. de Launay?” I
said, smiling. “But I fear you have had but a weary
journey.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” he answered lightly. “I have been
admiring your Devon scenery, which is only excelled,”
he added gallantly, “by the beauty of its women!”</p>

<p>And he made a bow to the pretty landlady, who smiled
and blushed in return, worthy of the Court of the Grand
Monarque from whence he came.</p>

<p>I could see that the cornet was burning with curiosity
to hear my story; but it was not until we had fully
supped that the marquis rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“If I have your permission, gentlemen,” he said, bowing,
“I think that I will retire.”</p>

<p>“So soon, monsieur?” the cornet cried. “The night
is young yet. Will you not take your revenge for your
losses of yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I beg that you will hold me excused,” he answered,
with a deprecating gesture. “I am feeling somewhat
fatigued, and there is a long journey ahead. I should
prefer, therefore, to seek my couch, if my good friend
the host will conduct me hither!” And with a courteous
bow he left the room.</p>

<p>When the door had closed upon him I drew my chair
again to the table and gave the cornet an account of what
had passed in my interview with Sir Richard Danvers.
He listened throughout in silence.</p>

<p>Only when I had finished: “What a woman!” he said
admiringly.</p>

<p>I knew of whom he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Suddenly he reached out his hand and raised his glass.
“I will give you a toast, captain,” he cried. “To the
health of Lady Ingram!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” I answered grimly; following his example, “to
the next meeting between us!”</p>

<p>Our arrival in London excited little curiosity, so common
at this time was the sight of a suspected Jacobite
being taken to Newgate or the Tower. In the city itself
we found the wildest rumours afloat. William had been
totally defeated in Ireland! Tourville with the French
fleet had entered the Thames! Whilst at the first sound
of his guns the Papists were to rise and commence a general
massacre!</p>

<p>These and a hundred other reports equally alarming
were greedily swallowed by the panic-stricken citizens.
It was not without real regret at parting with the marquis
that we arrived at length at the gate of the Tower
facing Tower Hill; for throughout the journey he had
proved a most entertaining companion. And though
his air of assumed gaiety did not deceive me as to the
secret anxiety he felt beneath it, yet he was a man who
had travelled much and could readily adapt himself to
the manners of the people with whom he was in company.
I doubt not that at Versailles he would have been
as stately a courtier as with us he was <i>bon camarade</i>.</p>

<p>The daylight was fast dying when, in answer to my
summons, the gate was at length opened by a surly
warder. And the usual formalities having been complied
with, I handed over the body of M. de Launay into the
custody of the lieutenant of the Tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Adieu,” I said at parting, taking the marquis’s
proffered hand. “And I trust, monsieur, that you will
speedily regain your liberty.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Who knows what evil fate lies before us!” he answered
lightly. “To-day, M. Cassilis, you are a free
man, a good horse beneath you, a sword at your side.
To-morrow, you may be—married!” And he disappeared
into the gloom of the gate-house.</p>

<p>I gave the word, and we turned our horses’ heads and
rode slowly back to the Bull Tavern in Cheapside, where
we put up for the night. On the morrow I dismissed the
cornet and his men with instructions to make all speed
in returning to Cleeve; and then with my lord’s letter
in my breast I set out through the city to deliver it to
the Earl of Nottingham.</p>

<p>In every square and open space the citizens were drilling,
whilst many of the shops and houses were barricaded
as if to withstand a siege, in expectation of the arrival of
the French. The earl dismissed my lord’s petition very
curtly, with a promise of some Dutch troops who were
arriving shortly from The Hague. And with this
promise I was forced to be content.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards I was back in the capital of the
West; and I stayed but to give his Grace of Nottingham’s
message to my Lord Danvers, and the next day set
out southwards.</p>

<p>It was evening when I found myself riding down the
valley road within a mile of Cleeve; and I will confess
that at every step that brought me nearer the house my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
heart beat more rapidly. How would my lady greet me!
What would she say to me, or I to her? It was in thinking
such thoughts as these and in picturing my welcome
that I arrived at length at the entrance gates and saw
that which brought me to a sudden halt.</p>

<p>In the earlier part of the day there had been a heavy
storm, and the torrents of rain that had then fallen had
softened the gravel surface of the avenue. Upon this
surface were the marks of many horses’ hoofs, and they
all led in the direction of the house.</p>

<p>I dismounted and examined them more closely. The
prints were fresh—not more than half an hour old; and
I speedily came to the conclusion that it was not De
Brito or any of his party, for these horses were shod in
a manner different to that of the troopers’ animals, such
as the one I bestrode.</p>

<p>Who, then, were these men, and for what purpose had
they come to Cleeve? Was my lady engaged in some
desperate scheme to assist the Stuart cause?</p>

<p>Clearly it was incumbent upon me to discover. I turned
aside, therefore, within the gates and led my horse
through the thick undergrowth to some little distance
from the road, and there left him; and I then made my
way cautiously through the trees that lined the avenue
on either side to a spot from which I obtained a sight of
the front of the house, which as yet I had only viewed by
night.</p>

<p>Seen by daylight, it was an old grey stone residence,
long and low; part of which, I subsequently found, dated
back to the reign of the first Tudor sovereign; though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
that portion of it that was nearest to me had been added
by the present earl. In front of the house lay a broad
stretch of green turf; and upon this, beneath a wide
spreading oak, a dozen horses were tethered. At some
little distance from these lounged a group of six or eight
serving men in conversation with the steward, whom I
easily recognised again, and who carried a large flagon
in his hand. I scanned the front of the house closely,
but there appeared no sign of life in its narrow mullioned
windows. If I would obtain further information
as to my lady’s guests, clearly I must seek for it elsewhere.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel, therefore, and made a wide detour
through the trees, coming out at length at the back of
the house. The house itself and the broad terrace that
ran behind it lay a little to my left, and I saw with satisfaction
that the windows nearest to me were lighted up,
and though I could not from my position see the interior
of the room itself, yet I felt that here, if anywhere,
was to be found the key of that which was to me at present
a mystery.</p>

<p>Concealing myself, therefore, in the deep shadow
afforded by a green mass of laurels, I set myself patiently
to wait until such time as I could approach the
house nearer with less risk of discovery. And fortunately
for my purpose the night was a dark one. Over the
manor roof a crescent moon hung low down in the heavens,
but such light as it afforded was shed upon the
front of the house, and the shadow fell the deeper upon
the broad terrace before me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>When it was as I judged sufficiently dark to make the
attempt, I stole across the grass, and softly crossing the
terrace, I gained the shadow of the house itself. Along
this I cautiously made my way, cursing my heavy boots,
that at every step I took grated harshly upon the gravel
walk. Presently I came to a halt. Twenty paces away,
the light from the nearest window fell in a broad white
patch upon the terrace, shining with a ghostly radiance
upon the low wall opposite that ran above the moat. To
appear within this circle of light without being seen by
any one within the room I saw at once was an impossibility.
Yet even as I stood hesitating what I should do
next, Fortune settled it for me in an unexpected manner.
For without warning the window opened outwards,
and a woman clad in white appeared upon the step.</p>

<p>I flattened myself against the ivy-covered wall behind
me, and so stood, scarcely daring to draw my breath,
for it needed but one glance to assure me that it was my
lady herself, the light from within shining full upon
her golden hair.</p>

<p>For it may be a minute she stood there gazing into the
night. Then with a weary gesture she raised her hand
to her brow, and turning on her heel, disappeared into
the room, and the light from the window vanished suddenly
from the terrace.</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes and stared again at the spot. In
place of the brightly illumined circle of a moment before
rested only impenetrable darkness. Yet from the three
windows beyond the light was still shining.</p>

<p>As the full significance of this fact dawned upon me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
I stole forward until I reached the step. And I was not
mistaken. Inadvertently in re-entering the room, my
lady had loosened the curtains, and they had fallen to behind
her.</p>

<p>From within came the sound of voices, but the curtains
were so thick that the words were indistinct and the light
shone through but faintly.</p>

<p>Cautiously I raised my hand and slightly parted the
heavy drapery before me, and the interior of the room
lay open to my gaze.</p>

<p>Upon the hearth, beside the carved stone chimney-piece,
stood my lady, the light of the candles shimmering in the
folds of her soft satin gown. Seated at a table near,
upon which lay the remains of a meal, were three men,
whom I had never before seen. At the head was a sallow,
hawk-faced man, with a certain stiffness of carriage that
sufficiently proclaimed a military career. He wore a full
bottomed periwig and was dressed in a suit of sober
black. The one nearest to me was more conspicuous.
He was an enormously stout man, in a coat of plum-coloured
velvet. He had laid aside his wig upon the table
before him, and the light shone upon his round bullet
head, crowned with a few scanty locks of hair, which he
mopped ever and again with a coloured kerchief. Facing
me was a young man of some twenty years of age,
dressed in a richly laced suit of grey and silver.</p>

<p>My lady was speaking, but in a voice so changed I
could scarcely recognise it as hers; for so far I had but
heard it hard and bitter with scorn; now it was soft and
raised in pleading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Oh,” she was saying, “how can you longer hesitate,
even for a moment? Or why delay? Surely you, Colonel
Wharton, know, depleted of troops as the country is at
present, now is the very time for all true friends of the
Stuart cause to proclaim themselves openly in arms!”</p>

<p>“Admitting the truth of all that you have said, madam,”
the man in black answered, “and the fact of the money
and arms being to hand at the time you mention, still I
cannot but look upon the enterprise as a most desperate
one.”</p>

<p>“Desperate?” the stout man cried. “’Tis suicide—sheer
suicide! Would you have me believe that the country
is any the more anxious to receive James back than it
was, two years ago, to be quit of him?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I do not understand you, sir!” my
lady answered. “You have heard what has already been
said!”</p>

<p>“Granted,” he replied quickly. “And now hear what
I have to say, madam. Is it right for us to risk our—”
he coughed slightly—“to risk the lives of these poor
peasants in a premature and ill-organized rising? The
sin of doing so is a matter to be considered, madam. We
should unite the—hum!—guile of the serpent——”</p>

<p>“With the courage of the hare!” put in the young man
contemptuously.</p>

<p>“With the—hum!—courage of the quadruped mentioned,”
the other continued, without apparently noticing
the sarcasm. “And the affair should be approached
with all due circumspection. I think that is the correct
phrase, Colonel Wharton?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>“Certainly, certainly,” the latter answered. “It is but
sound common sense.”</p>

<p>“And it savours to me,” the young man cried impatiently,
“to be more of——”</p>

<p>“Rupert,” my lady interrupted quickly, “be silent, I
beg of you!”</p>

<p>“Of what, young man?” the colonel said in his precise
tone, fixing his eyes upon the other’s face. “Of caution,
you should say. For take the word of an old soldier who
has seen some service in his time, I say that arm your enthusiasts
as you will, they will never stand against disciplined
troops. And we want no second Monmouth
affair to teach us wisdom!”</p>

<p>“But you forget, Colonel Wharton,” my lady cried.
“What of the French troops that Louis will send us?”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, madam,” the colonel replied gloomily.
“That he <i>says</i> he will send us! I am of opinion that if
the house of Stuart relies upon French assistance for its
restoration, that event will not take place in my lifetime;
although you, madam,” he added, “may possibly live to
see a grandson of James ascend the throne!”</p>

<p>“The more reason, sir, that we should act, relying on
ourselves,” the young man cried quickly; and the glance
of gratitude my lady gave him was not lost on me. “I
am of opinion that never before have James’s affairs
worn so favourable an aspect. And I, for one, gentlemen,
am ready and willing to tread the path her ladyship
points out, though, it should lead me to the scaffold!”</p>

<p>“Ah, youth! youth! there spoke thy language,” the
stout man said, shaking his head slowly with a movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
that set his pendulous chin quivering. “Not that I
blame Sir Rupert Courtenay for being outspoken,” he
added, somewhat hastily, as the other half rose from
his seat. “At his age I was like him.”</p>

<p>“Young in years I may be,” the other cried hotly.
“’Tis a fault that time will remedy. At least, I am not
a——”</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” my lady cried pleadingly, “for my sake,
do not quarrel. Oh,” she continued passionately, “what
ill fate clings around the Stuarts, that among their
friends every measure formed on their behalf is born to
perish in the rifts of selfish strife!”</p>

<p>“If I spoke somewhat hastily, sir,” the young man said
sullenly, “you must put it down to my Courtenay blood.
I am willing for this lady’s sake to withdraw my words.”</p>

<p>“Let it pass, sir, let it pass,” the other answered with
a wave of the hand. “As between gentlemen they are
already forgotten.”</p>

<p>“And may I be permitted to know, madam,” the colonel
broke in, “the names of those who have consented to aid
you in this scheme ’ere adding my own to the number—if
I approve of it,” he added.</p>

<p>I saw that for a moment my lady hesitated.</p>

<p>Then she drew a folded paper from the bosom of her
gown. “See,” she cried eagerly with shining eyes.
“Here is the authority for what I do, and with the signature
of the king himself—my king!” imprinting a kiss
upon the parchment. “Gentlemen, I rely upon your
honour for their non-divulgence,” she added quietly,
laying it upon the table before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>The colonel bowed in acquiescence; and drawing a
candle to him, unfolded the paper and glanced at its
contents. Suddenly he raised his eyes.</p>

<p>“I see that your ladyship’s name heads the list,” he
said shortly.</p>

<p>“I should be base indeed to ask others to risk danger
that I feared to dare myself,” she answered proudly.</p>

<p>And I, the silent watcher without, asked myself how he
could longer hesitate. Had I been in the man’s place,
had my lady so looked and spoken to me—pshaw! what
foolishness was this! The woman had beaten me like
a hound; and I held her life and the lives of the men before
me in the hollow of my hand! And I had heard and
seen enough of the latter to sum up, in my own mind at
least, their characters. God help my lady’s scheme if
she depended on such men as these for its success!</p>

<p>The colonel finished reading; and with a totally impassive
face handed the paper in silence to the stout man
beside him.</p>

<p>The latter perused it with sundry short ejaculations;
then:</p>

<p>“Hum!” he said at last. “These are well-known names,
madam.”</p>

<p>“That being so,” my lady replied quickly, “and my
cousin,” she added, indicating the young man in grey—“having
already signed, it only remains for you, gentlemen,
to do likewise!”</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” the stout man replied, rising hastily to his
feet. “Let there be no waiting, madam! I will put no
pen to paper! What!” he added hastily, meeting my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
lady’s look of wondering contempt, “would you have
me hazard my life into the keeping of any one who would
sell it, for aught I know, upon the first opportunity?”</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> shall keep the paper, sir,” my lady answered coldly.</p>

<p>“That may be, madam, that may be,” he continued,
working himself into a rage. “And it may suit these
gentlemen,” he added, tapping the paper in his hand,
“but it is not so agreeable to me. And besides that, I
am not sure that my conscience will suffer me to aid
you.”</p>

<p>“Your conscience!” my lady cried with infinite scorn.</p>

<p>“Aye, madam, my conscience,” he went on, no whit
taken aback; “for whether you succeed or fail, shall
I be privy to that which will again bring bloodshed with
its attendant misery upon the people of this country?”</p>

<p>I waited no longer.</p>

<p>“I will answer that question for you, sir,” I cried
clearly, stepping into the room. “You will <i>not</i>!”</p>

<p>My lady uttered a low cry and stood as if turned to
stone, with parted lips and straining eyes. The two men
who were seated half rose, clutching at the table before
them in the extremity of their surprise. As for the stout
man, when his glance lighted upon my uniform he caught
his breath with a gasp of mortal fear and fell back into
his chair with ashen face and quivering lips, and the
paper fluttered from his nerveless fingers.</p>

<p>In three strides I crossed the floor, and in a moment the
paper was in my hand. The next and I had thrust it in
my breast. That broke the spell.</p>

<p>“You!” my lady gasped in a choking voice.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_090">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_090.jpg" alt="‘You!’ my lady gasped in a choking voice">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“‘You!’ my lady gasped in a choking voice”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Yes, I, madam!” I answered quickly. “You did not
expect me to return so speedily! You keep strange company
at Cleeve, my lady,” I continued sneeringly. “And
such that whilst I take up my residence in this house you
will do well to regulate.”</p>

<p>Ere she could reply the younger of the men sprang to
his feet, upsetting his chair in the act.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, the paper!” he cried. “To me, colonel!
We must have it at all hazards!” And he drew his sword.
An example which was not followed, however, by the
cravens at his side. Remembering the serving men I had
seen without, I saw that the matter was getting serious,
and I had no wish to hurt the lad.</p>

<p>“One moment,” I cried sternly, raising my hand with a
gesture of command. “I beg that you will not put me to
the trouble of summoning the troopers who wait without;
for I think that you forget, gentlemen,” I continued
slowly, “that if I arrest you in this house, the consequences
to my lady will be of the gravest character—consequences,”
I added, “which I am as desirous of avoiding
as you are for reasons of my own.”</p>

<p>I saw that my words took effect. The man before me
hesitated and then stood still, frowning. I suppose that
a moment’s reflection showed him the truth of what I had
said, for he slowly sank his point.</p>

<p>“What, then, do you propose to do?” he said at last;
and I knew by the tone of his voice that the game was
in my own hands. Henceforth everything was easy. I
would show my lady who was the master here.</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” I answered quietly. “But you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
oblige me, Sir Rupert Courtenay—I think that I have
the name correctly—by first laying your sword upon the
table. And, Colonel Wharton, yours. No hesitation,
gentlemen,” I continued sternly. “I have force sufficient
to ensure obedience.”</p>

<p>Still for a moment he wavered in doubt.</p>

<p>“And if I comply, sir, with your request,” he said
slowly, “what guarantee have I that this lady shall suffer
no harm?”</p>

<p>“My word of honour, sir,” I answered quietly.</p>

<p>“Honour?” my lady cried quickly. “If you look for
aught of honour from this gentleman, I warn you that
you will look in vain!”</p>

<p>“I thank you for your good opinion of me, madam,” I
answered calmly, “which, coming from your ladyship,
was such as I should have expected. And I can the more
readily overlook your words, since I know how inopportune
must be my presence. But I think that for the
present it is for me to command and for you to
obey.”</p>

<p>“I waited a moment, but she did not speak. She only
looked at me. Yet that look hurt me more than words.
Despite my assumed air of carelessness, the scorn and
loathing in her eyes made me wince.</p>

<p>“And I will give your ladyship a word of future advice,”
I continued with a sneer. “Open windows consort ill with
conspiracy!”</p>

<p>“I trust, sir, that you do not include me in that category,”
the colonel broke in suddenly, “for I think that
you have no evidence to support such an assertion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“No evidence at all,” the stout man cried, recovering
somewhat from his first shock of surprise. Though if
ever conscious guilt looked out of a man’s eyes, it was
in his, and his twitching lip belied his air of assurance.
“Not a shadow of it!” he continued, growing bolder at
the sound of his own voice. “And if you were listening,
captain, you heard what I was saying. As a magistrate
of this country it is my duty—hum!—strictly in the interests
of government to acquaint myself with the opinions
of the most influential families. Had you delayed
your appearance a moment longer, you would have heard
the measures I was about to take to—hum!—counteract
the scheme of this misguided lady!”</p>

<p>“As to that,” I replied—and I could afford to forgive
him his cowardice—for the man was playing into my
hands, “I am willing to take your word for it, Mr.——?”</p>

<p>“Wetherell,” he answered—“Nicholas Wetherell, at
your service. I am well known, sir! I believe that I
can honestly say,” he added pompously, “that I am a
man of some weight in the city of Exeter.”</p>

<p>I looked him steadily in the face.</p>

<p>“I do not doubt it,” I answered quietly.</p>

<p>The young baronet gave a short laugh and the colonel’s
mouth writhed itself into a grim smile. Nay, for a moment
even I thought that my lady’s face relaxed somewhat;
but, meeting my eyes, she stiffened again into her
old mask of scorn.</p>

<p>“Yet I do not know, Mr. Wetherell,” I continued dryly,
“that the government would entirely approve of your
method of obtaining information.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“There is no more loyal subject, sir, in England than
I!” he cried hastily.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” I answered, “I think that your loyalty, sir,
is as strong as your courage!”</p>

<p>“And I trust that the latter does not need to be questioned,
captain,” he blustered.</p>

<p>“It does <i>not</i>!” I replied, with I fear some of the contempt
I felt for the man appearing in my voice. “But
I will put your loyalty to the test. You have wine
there,” I continued, stepping to the table, the whilst they
watched me in silence. “As loyal subjects, therefore, you
will not refuse to join me in drinking a toast.”</p>

<p>I slowly filled four glasses, three of which I placed in
the centre of the table.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” I cried clearly, raising the fourth, “to
the health of his Majesty, King William!”</p>

<p>For it may be ten seconds they sat silent. The room
was very still. I gazed full at my lady where she stood
upon the hearth. She was leaning slightly forward, her
hands pressed against her bosom, watching the scene before
her with fascinated eyes. It was a battle of our
wills and I had won!</p>

<p>Suddenly the stout man stretched out a shaking hand.</p>

<p>“To the health of King William, sir!” he cried quickly,
all the more anxious to make up for his first slight hesitation.
“I desire no better toast.” And he drained his
glass.</p>

<p>“Nor I also,” said the colonel more slowly. “To King
William, sir! I wish him success in his campaign!”</p>

<p>But I noticed that he avoided meeting my lady’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>I turned to the young baronet. And here I expected
trouble.</p>

<p>“Sir Rupert Courtenay,” I said quietly, “it is your
turn!”</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, and I saw a quick glance
pass between him and my lady. Then, to my surprise,
he gave a light laugh and raised his glass.</p>

<p>“I drink to the king!” he cried clearly, with a defiant
look at me.</p>

<p>I noted mentally his reservation, and I knew whom
he meant. But it was not my cue to quarrel with him.
I was more than content with my victory.</p>

<p>“Good!” I said aloud, following his example. “That is
sufficient, sir!” and I replaced my glass upon the table.
“I will not detain you longer, gentlemen,” I added. “I
have already said that for reasons of my own I am willing
to overlook your presence here. Whether I take further
steps in the matter will depend entirely upon your future
conduct. But for the present, gentlemen, there is
the door. I should recommend you to take your departure
with all speed. The night air is somewhat
chilly!”</p>

<p>And they needed no further urging. Without a word
the stout man replaced his wig upon his head and, catching
up his hat, started for the door. Perhaps he feared
that I might yet repent my clemency. And the colonel
was not slow to follow his example. True, he had the
decency first to turn to my lady, as if to make his
adieux; but one glance at her rigid figure and burning
eyes was sufficient for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“This comes of having a woman in it,” he said shortly,
turning on his heel and leaving the room.</p>

<p>I glanced at my lady. Her head was bent. I could
not see her face. Suddenly, with a quick, defiant movement
she upraised it, tossing the hair from her forehead.</p>

<p>“Cousin Rupert,” she cried proudly, “your arm!”</p>

<p>The young baronet hastened to do her bidding, and
she moved by me, drawing her scented skirts aside, lest
they should touch me in passing. At the door, still with
her hand upon his arm, she turned.</p>

<p>“You have beaten me twice, sir,” she said, in a voice
trembling with passion. “For your own sake beware
of the third time!” And she swept out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>OF HOW I PLAYED KNIGHT-ERRANT, AND OF MY LADY’S
GRATITUDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> my lady had left the room and the swish of her
silken skirts had ceased I hastened to take my departure,
for I did not doubt that if it was discovered I had come
alone and that the troopers of whose presence I had
talked so glibly existed only in my own imagination, her
ladyship would take active measures for the recovery of
the paper in my possession.</p>

<p>I stepped through the window, therefore, and sought
the spot where I had left my horse. I took the bridle
in my hand, and, avoiding the avenue leading to the
gates, led him through the tangled undergrowth until
we came out, some hundred yards below, upon the road.</p>

<p>Here I halted and looked back. There was no sound
to break the stillness save the soft sighing of the night
wind in the branches overhead. At my feet the white
road stretched away into the night, silent and lonely.</p>

<p>I lost no time, therefore, in mounting, and a few minutes
later, without molestation, reached the village.</p>

<p>As I rode up the main street I saw that the troopers
had quartered themselves upon the inhabitants; for a
dozen or more were lounging in the open doorways upon
either side of the road, who upon catching sight of my
face, stiffened their backs and saluted me as I passed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
Before the inn itself a noisier group were gathered,
whose laughter and jests died away for a moment as I
dismounted, to again break out with renewed clamour
when I had crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Calling for a light, I made my way to the little chamber
that I had previously occupied. Carefully fastening the
door behind me and satisfying myself that I was indeed
alone, I set the candle upon the little table and drew the
precious paper from my breast—the paper big with the
fate of my lady’s freedom! Perhaps in the temper of
the times her life! For I well knew that in the nation’s
present state of panic the government would have little
consideration and respect for either rank or sex. And
’twas well known that the Earl of Ingram was one of
James’s most trusted councillors.</p>

<p>The paper itself was a small sheet of coarse white
parchment and was folded into three.</p>

<p>As I stood turning it over in my hands, on a sudden
my lady’s face seemed to confront me.</p>

<p>Again I went over the scene so lately enacted, again I
heard her clear voice raised in pleading, and moved by
some impulse of I know not what, I laid the paper unopened
upon the table, and with the candle in my hand
I went down on my knees upon the dusty floor.</p>

<p>Presently in the corner of the room farthest from the
window I found that which I sought—a loosened board.</p>

<p>With the aid of my sword I raised one end of this, and
in the cavity beneath I slipped the fateful parchment,
replacing afterwards the board and removing all traces
of my handiwork. It was not until this was accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
that I breathed more freely, and I sought my couch with
a distinctly lighter heart.</p>

<p>It was late next morning when I awoke, and the bright
June sunshine was streaming into the room through the
little latticed window. I dressed hastily and descended
to the inn parlour, where I found the two cornets already
at the table. During the meal I gathered from Cornet
Graham some information respecting Cleeve. The village
itself and the surrounding farms belonging to the
Ingram family contained some eight hundred inhabitants;
but of this number, fully two hundred—being the
young and able-bodied men—were serving under the earl
in Ireland. Of the remaining number some eighty only
were males, and these the greybeards or youths too young
to endure the arduous duties of the Irish campaign.</p>

<p>When I had made myself acquainted with such gossip
as he had at his command, I gave the cornets their orders
for the day, and returning to my room, arrayed myself
in full uniform. Also whilst in London I had taken the
opportunity of visiting a tailor’s shop in the Haymarket
and purchasing to myself sundry little fripperies of
attire, such as a lace cravat and fashionable peruke, the
which I smiled at myself for donning. Nevertheless, I
was minded to look my best when I again presented myself
at Cleeve.</p>

<p>My vanity satisfied, I made my way to the stables, and
mounting my horse, set out for the manor.</p>

<p>Evidently my arrival had been expected, and my lady
had given her orders as to my future treatment; for as
I reined in my horse and dismounted before the door, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
a sudden it opened, and the steward came to the head of
the steps. Behind him I caught a glimpse of a little
group of servants, most of whom were women, who regarded
me with feminine curiosity.</p>

<p>“Is it your pleasure to enter, sir?” said the steward
respectfully, though the sullen hate in his eyes belied his
deferential manner.</p>

<p>“And my horse?” I said curtly, ascending the steps.</p>

<p>“Shall be looked to, never fear,” he replied; then, raising
his voice: “Martin!” he cried; and at his call the
youth who had accompanied him upon the ride to Exeter
came slowly forward from the group behind. “Take
this gentleman’s horse to the stables.”</p>

<p>“And see that he lacks for nothing,” I said grimly, “or
you will regret it, my friend!”</p>

<p>For I had not forgotten this same youth’s insolence to
me upon the road, and I was determined to show these
people that for the present, at least, I was their master.</p>

<p>When he had moved away, muttering and cursing to
himself, I followed the steward to the dining hall, which
I have previously described. Everything in it was as I
had seen it upon my first arrival, only the room was
empty.</p>

<p>“My lady is out?” I said carelessly.</p>

<p>“No,” the steward answered slowly; “she is not out,
but——”</p>

<p>“She is not desirous of seeing me, you would say?” I
answered quickly. “Be frank, man! I understand.
And for the present it is a matter of indifference to me,
as I intend to make myself acquainted with the gardens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
and the cliffs adjoining. But you will prepare a room
for me,” I continued, watching him out of the corner
of my eye; “and also inform your mistress that I dine
at noon, and must then request their ladyships’ presence.”</p>

<p>The start he gave did not escape me.</p>

<p>“My ladies will dine with you?” he stammered.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I replied harshly. “Is there any reason
why they should not? Or does it require another necklet
to teach you that I am a man to be obeyed?” And
with this parting shot I left him. At the threshold of
the room I turned. He still stood in the centre of the
floor, apparently bereft of speech.</p>

<p>“The hour is noon,” I said quietly, “and I beg that
they will not keep me waiting.”</p>

<p>Arrived in the open air, for the first time I remembered
that I had not as yet seen the gigantic figure of Sampson
Dare; and encountering the youth Martin, I asked what
had become of him.</p>

<p>He looked up for a moment from his task.</p>

<p>“He is not here,” he said, scowling.</p>

<p>“I asked you <i>where</i> he was,” I answered dryly.</p>

<p>“In London, then, if it will please you,” he retorted
sullenly.</p>

<p>“Ah!” was all I said in reply. And turning on my heel,
I left him. But I understood perfectly upon what errand
the man had gone, and I saw by this, even if I had not
received ample proof already, that my lady was not a
woman to let the grass grow under her feet. Doubtless
she had powerful friends in London whom she trusted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to interest government on her behalf. If so, I thought,
time alone will show whether her confidence was misplaced.</p>

<p>For the present, at least, I held the winning cards.</p>

<p>From the stables I took the first broad path, and finally
came to the cliffs, where I stumbled upon the little path
which we had ascended fourteen days previously in the
darkness and storm.</p>

<p>And the longer I looked at it, the more I wondered that
our attempt on such a night had not ended in disaster.
Even by daylight it was no pleasant task to tread the
narrow ledge, as I discovered for myself when I essayed
to make the descent. No pleasant knowledge, that a
single slip or a momentary giddiness would precipitate
me into the sapphire sea, slumbering peacefully a hundred
feet below.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I persevered in the attempt, and in due
time reached the beach.</p>

<p>On the flat slab of rock at the bottom of the steps I
paused. The tide was fast coming in, and the first waves
were gently rocking the boat, that still lay where we
had before seen it, in the little bay beneath the cliff.</p>

<p>The sun beat fiercely down upon my head and sparkled
upon the crests of the waves, until the whole surface of
the water resembled a sea of burnished silver. Presently
my eyes lighted upon something that roused in me a
momentary curiosity. The beach, as I have previously
said, was composed of small, grey pebbles; but about
ten feet from the foot of the cliff lay a patch of hard
sand, some twelve feet square, its smooth, yellow surface<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
showing plainer by reason of the slate-coloured
shingle surrounding it. How it had come in such a place
was beyond my imagination to fathom.</p>

<p>For some minutes I stood gazing over the sea; then,
turning, I retraced my steps, and passing idly through
the sunlit gardens, reached the house.</p>

<p>It wanted a few minutes to the hour when I entered the
dining hall, and I saw that my instructions had been
obeyed.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, a table, laden with massive
silver plate, had been set out for three. I laid aside
my hat and sword and waited for my guests’ appearance
with a heart that beat more rapidly than was its wont.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was five minutes past the hour of noon
when the steward appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>“How is this?” I said curtly. “You carried my message?”</p>

<p>“My ladies would know if you command their presence?”
he answered slowly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” I cried impatiently. “<i>Command</i> them, then,
in the devil’s name!”</p>

<p>“I will not fail to give them your orders,” he retorted
quickly, and was gone ere I could make reply.</p>

<p>And presently they came.</p>

<p>Long ere they entered the room I heard the soft rustling
of their gowns and the click of their heels upon the
polished oaken floor. The younger sister’s face was
pale, with a certain shrinking timidity in the covert
glance she stole at me. My lady’s face was stone, and
her eyes were hard and glittering. I bowed low to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
on their entering, a salute which the younger woman
returned with a slight acknowledgment, and which my
lady totally ignored.</p>

<p>When they had seated themselves opposite me, and
the steward had placed the covers upon the table, I lost
some of my original nervousness in fulfilling the civilities
of the table. And I strove to appear entirely at my ease,
praising the beauty of the gardens and the cooking of
the dishes before us. But to all my conversation—nay,
even to direct questions, the younger woman replied only
in monosyllables—my lady not at all.</p>

<p>And they made no pretence of eating what I pressed
upon them. Stately and still, they sat and looked at me.
And gradually I froze!</p>

<p>They could not have hit upon a better device whereby
to unnerve me. Minute by minute, try as I would, my
assumed air of assurance left me. Beneath the gaze of
my lady’s scornful eyes, of her rigid figure and curled
lip—that all proclaimed my presence as pollution—I
felt the hot blood mantling to my brow, and the words
died stammering from my tongue.</p>

<p>I strove to gather courage from the wine before me,
and my hand was shaking.</p>

<p>Presently I could bear it no longer, and I pushed my
plate from me and rose to my feet.</p>

<p>“If you would prefer for the future to dine alone,
madam,” I said sullenly, “you have my permission to do
so.”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the concession, sir,” my lady said
coldly; “which, being prisoners, we have no right to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
expect. Also as our jailer,” she continued with bitter
emphasis, “is it permitted us to take our daily ride
alone?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” I answered; though the scathing contempt
in her voice and eyes made me wince. “I see no reason
against your doing so! And believe me, madam,” I
continued earnestly, “excepting in so far as my duty
here compels me, I have no desire to interfere with your
actions or restrain your freedom.” Yet I might
have spared myself the confession, for without a
word of thanks from either of them they moved away.
“And one word more, madam,” I continued, as
they reached the doorway; “the paper——?” and I
hesitated.</p>

<p>My lady turned quickly at the words.</p>

<p>“The paper which you stole, sir?” she said coldly.</p>

<p>“Which I—— You use a harsh phrase, madam,” I
answered irrelevantly, advancing a few paces nearer
to her. On a sudden I was minded to prove to her that
she was unjust to me—to shame her for her words. “I
had no wish,” I continued in a low voice, “to use it to
your injury, my lady, and so——”</p>

<p>“You can spare me further, sir!” she interrupted icily.
“Your insolence I can bear for the present, but not
your hypocrisy. That you are present here to-day is
insult enough to my womanhood; for the rest, I pray
you keep as far from me as the limits of this house
permit.”</p>

<p>For a moment I stood before her tongue-tied and
trembling. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“Very well, madam,” I said harshly. “As you please!
I was about to say that this paper is no longer in my
possession, but in the hands of those who will make ruthless
use of it should any accident befall me! I am aware
that the cliffs of Cleeve are dangerous,” I added meaningly;
and with a bow I went back to my seat.</p>

<p>But alone with my thoughts, I cursed the foolishness
that had led me to demand their presence, and I laid the
humiliation I felt at my lady’s door. Bah! ’twas a pitiful
little triumph, and one worthy of her! As I recalled the
look that had shone in her eyes I bit my lip savagely and
strove with what appetite I could rally to complete my
meal. But the taste had gone from the dishes, the wine
was sour.</p>

<p>Presently, in sheer ill humour with things in general,
and with my lady in particular, I rose from the table,
and making my way to the stables, mounted my horse
and set out for the village.</p>

<p>Arrived there, I assembled the astonished troopers, and
there for an hour I drilled them in the little square before
the inn. And well for the knaves that they gave me no
offence upon which to vent my rage, for it would have
gone hard with the offender, whomsoever he might have
been.</p>

<p>It was whilst engaged in this duty that I became aware
of the clatter of a horse’s hoofs approaching rapidly
down the village street, and looked up to meet my lady’s
scornful eyes, a smile of disdain upon her lips.</p>

<p>’Twas but a moment’s glimpse I gained of her, the
next and she had passed; but for me the pleasure had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
gone from my task and again my thoughts were embittered.</p>

<p>Accordingly I dismissed the men somewhat curtly, and
turning my horse’s head, rode past the church in the
direction which my lady had taken. I went at a foot
pace, however, for I had no desire to overtake the woman
in front; at the same time, I was minded to ride as far
as Cleevesborough, the tall hill rising to the south of
the village. To overtake her? My faith, no! Henceforth
I would avoid her and so follow her advice. At
the foot of the hill I fastened my horse to a straggling
thorn bush and ascended the rest of the way on foot.
From the summit I glanced below me.</p>

<p>Some two miles distant my lady showed as a rapidly
moving speck upon the ribbon of white road that wound
down the valley. A mile or so beyond her I could distinguish
the upper portion of a large black-timbered
mansion rising above the surrounding trees. Long
after she had disappeared beneath the latter, I still remained
upon the summit of the hill, admiring the beauty
of the scene. At length I descended to where I had left
my horse, and mounting, rode slowly down to the level
of the road. Arrived there, however, I determined that
I would not return by the way that I had come, but would
strike inland and make my way in a half circle back to
Cleeve.</p>

<p>With this intention I crossed the road and entered the
trees upon the opposite side. I found that these did not
continue for more than a few hundred yards, giving
place to a succession of little grass-grown hollows, covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
with sparse, brown bracken, and here and there a
scattered boulder breaking through the coarse turf.</p>

<p>In most of these depressions were pools of stagnant
water and patches of black bogland that required some
caution in avoiding, so that it was not without satisfaction
that about a mile farther I came upon a path. It
was a mere bridle track running down the centre of the
hollow, and was little used, as I saw at once by the marks
of the hoof prints upon its surface, which were fully a
week old. I set my face in the direction of Cleeve, and
the sorrel broke into a trot. The track led from hollow
to hollow, some broad, some narrow, and for the most
part with marshy, reed-grown ground on either side.</p>

<p>I rode with slackened rein, my hat pressed low upon
my brow, and I gave myself up to my thoughts—thoughts
in which my lady strangely mingled.</p>

<p>The sun beat down with almost tropical heat upon me;
and what little wind there had been on the uplands above
was here shut out by the slopes upon either side.</p>

<p>How far I had proceeded thus I do not know, for lulled
by the rhythmic stroke of my horse’s hoofs, with half-closed
eyes I took no account of time.</p>

<p>On a sudden the sorrel stopped with a jerk that all but
unseated me. Then he commenced to back, and I felt
his flanks quiver. In an instant I was alert, and I
searched the pathway in front with my eyes, thinking
perhaps some viper or creature of the bog had startled
him. But I could see nothing.</p>

<p>Slipping from the saddle, therefore, I soothed the
frightened animal as best I could, and glanced keenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
around me. I was in a deeper depression than any I
had as yet traversed—a circular, cup-shaped hollow, its
sides sloping some quarter of a mile to the ridge above.
In front of me stretched the path, to right and left of
it patches of bogland, its black surface covered with
slime and green water-weed.</p>

<p>Stay, was it the path? I bent and gazed fixedly at the
track before me, then, unbuckling my sword, I slowly advanced,
probing the ground in front of me. At the
sixth step my sword encountered no resistance. I drew
back with a shudder, and, despite the heat of the day, a
cold chill ran down my back. Again I tested the spot
with my sword. The green mass quivered at my touch,
but there was no solid ground, and in a moment the truth
flashed upon me.</p>

<p>The bog upon the right, which stretched some distance
up the slope, had slipped, undermining the path, which
at a casual glance still retained its ordinary appearance
by reason of the green entangled weed floating upon its
stagnant surface.</p>

<p>Never had Nature cunningly concealed a man-trap
more treacherous. But for my horse’s sagacity I should
have been—pah! the very thought of sinking slowly
beneath the noisome ooze made me shudder. I turned
away, and taking the bridle rein in my hand, I skirted
round the smaller patch of bogland on the left and regained
the track beyond.</p>

<p>Arrived there, however, I did not at once ride forward.
On the contrary, I retraced my steps to the brink of the
bog, for I was minded to see how far the pathway was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
undermined. To the spot where I had stood before upon
the opposite side was, as near as I could judge, some
fifteen feet. I cast about for some means of warning
travellers of their danger; but there was nothing but
the bare hillside around me, and with a shrug I turned
away. After all, what concern was it of mine? Resolving,
however, for the future to take to the ridges and
to avoid the low-lying ground, I remounted my horse
and headed straight for the top of the hollow, some quarter
of a mile distant. I had all but reached the summit
of the slope when a dull sound struck upon my ear—the
regular thud, thud of a horse’s hoofs and of a horse
ridden at speed.</p>

<p>I drew rein in idle curiosity as to who the rider might
be in such an unfrequented spot. Nearer and nearer
came the sound behind me, and a minute or so later the
horse and its rider flashed into sight.</p>

<p>It was my lady herself!</p>

<p>My lady mounted on the chestnut mare that I had so
admired. And in a moment I understood. The green
track that had nearly proved fatal to me led to the
mansion I had seen from the summit of Cleevesborough,
the smooth turf forming a more pleasant bridle path
to the village than the dusty road.</p>

<p>Along this pathway my lady was sweeping at full
gallop, was sweeping to the death that lurked below!
And I hated her!</p>

<p>But even as the thought came to me I gathered up
the reins, drove in my spurs, and in a moment I was
thundering down the slope. Even now, though years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
have lapsed, how the memory of that ride comes back
to me!</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile distant, at right angles
to me, and somewhat nearer than I to the green pitfall
below, came the chestnut at full gallop, spurning the
ground from beneath her flying hoofs. And with a certain
shrinking of the heart I could in nowise account
for, moment by moment I realised that the sorrel I bestrode
was no match for the more thoroughbred and
lighter weight of the animal before me. And seeing this,
I rose in my stirrups and shouted. It may have been
that my words were drowned in the thunder of our
galloping hoofs. It may be, seeing that it was I—nay,
more likely, I thought bitterly, <i>because</i> it was I—my
lady took no heed. And in my heart I cursed the wilfulness
of this woman who would take naught from me,
not even words of warning. Yet this very wilfulness
made me but the more resolved to save her—to save her
at all hazards! I settled myself, therefore, more firmly
in the saddle, and the race continued. And now less
than two hundred yards divided us—two hundred yards
and the morass between.</p>

<p>Also, now that I was nearer, I realised that for once
I had done my lady an injustice, and that the animal
beneath her was far beyond her control. So clear, indeed,
was the air, so brilliant the glaring light, that I
could mark the chestnut’s straining eyes and the white
foam flying from her lips—aye, and I could clearly distinguish
the outline of my lady’s graceful figure as she
rose and fell to the mare’s stride—could see the dainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
head and glowing cheek, the proud, oval face, and the
stray tresses of golden hair escaping from beneath her
grey-velvet riding hat. And now she was but forty
yards distant from the brink, and spur as I would, the
sorrel might do no more.</p>

<p>Again I rose in my stirrups.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, beware of the bog, madam!” I
shouted, pointing to the ground between us. “Turn
to the left! To the left!” For I saw that her only
chance lay in skirting round the smaller patch as I had
previously done. And now, indeed, despite her contempt
for me, something in my voice must have attracted my
lady’s attention, and, accustomed as she was to the nature
of the surrounding country, her quick eyes discerned
her danger; for I saw her throw her whole weight upon
the left rein.</p>

<p>But it was too late, nothing could stop the chestnut
now, and seeing this, my lady abandoned the attempt,
and arriving at the brink, she lifted the mare with her
hand and essayed the leap instead.</p>

<p>For a moment, as she rose into the air, I closed my eyes,
and but opened them upon hearing the dull thud with
which the mare alighted in safety upon the near side.</p>

<p>Not quite, for her hind feet striking upon the very
edge of the path, the soft, spongy turf gave way beneath
the shock, and she rolled back into the bog.</p>

<p>Yet my lady was safe. Even in mid air she had freed
her foot from the stirrup, and as the mare struck the
ground she sprang clear—to fall, indeed, upon her hands
and knees on the soft turf a dozen paces distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>A moment later I reached the spot and flung myself
from the saddle. My lady had already regained her
feet.</p>

<p>“You are not hurt, madam?” I cried anxiously, forgetful
for the moment of the hatred between us.</p>

<p>She did not answer me. No doubt the fall had dazed
her. Instead, she turned in the direction of her horse
and took two steps forward. But I was too quick for
her.</p>

<p>“Have a care, madam!” I cried, barring her further
progress. “This is no woman’s task, and the ground is
dangerous. Trust me,” I continued earnestly, “to do all
that is possible to save your favourite.” I turned from
her as I spoke and made my way to the edge of the bog.</p>

<p>With eyes dilated with terror and blood-red nostrils
distended, the mare still struggled to regain her footing.
At no little risk to myself of being drawn into the bog,
I succeeded at length in laying hold of the rein, and I
drove my heels into the turf and exerted all my strength—aye,
till the muscles of my back and arms cracked
beneath the strain—in a vain endeavour to assist her
efforts. But though her forefeet, indeed, rested upon the
more solid ground, her struggles were growing fainter
and she was sinking rapidly. I saw that it was a question
of moments only, and there was but one expedient.
Loosing hold of the rein with my right hand, I drew
my sword and thrust her lightly in the breast.</p>

<p>At the touch of the steel she gave a snort of mingled
pain and terror and rose from her knees. Her hoofs
caught, slipped upon the soft, wet turf, caught again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
as I threw my weight into the scale, and the next moment
I was on my back upon the grass, and the hollow spun
round me in a golden mist. ’Twas but a second or two
I lay there, however, for the mare’s head had caught me
fairly in the chest and the breath was gone from my
body. Then I slowly rose to my feet and turned to look
behind me. Twenty paces away my lady stood soothing
the frightened animal, that now stood quivering
with terror from head to foot.</p>

<p>I approached her slowly, with a feeling of exultation in
my breast. For had I not proved my words to her and
succeeded? Had I not by service rendered placed her in
my debt? Surely I had earned this woman’s gratitude,
and I would take it as my just reward. She did not look
at me as I approached. Instead, she drew a snow-white
kerchief from the bosom of her gown and with ostentatious
care began to staunch the blood that welled from
the wound I had inflicted upon the mare’s breast. One
might almost have supposed that she thought more of
this slight wound than if the animal itself had been engulfed.
Three paces from her was a large flat boulder,
one of many that lay scattered upon the turf. By the
side of this I halted. Still she did not turn her
head.</p>

<p>Her hat had fallen back, revealing the tresses of golden
hair straying in wild disorder upon her neck. I had
leisure to observe more closely the exquisite symmetry of
her figure, displayed as it was to its best advantage by
the tight-fitting riding coat she wore.</p>

<p>Feeling, I suppose, my eyes upon her, she deliberately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
turned her back on me and continued her task as before.
I waited two—three—minutes, still she did not speak.</p>

<p>“Am I to have no thanks, madam?” I said at length in
a low voice.</p>

<p>“It was a praiseworthy action,” she answered icily;
“and as such doubtless carries its own reward.”</p>

<p>On a sudden my exultation vanished at her words. It
was borne in on me that she would rather have been
beholden to the meanest beggar upon the road than to me.
Yet I would not be discouraged so easily. Again I broke
the silence:</p>

<p>“I do not think that the animal is much hurt, madam,”
I said humbly. “’Tis but a flesh wound at most. Nevertheless,
in case of further mishap, may I be permitted to
return with you?”</p>

<p>And then indeed she looked at me.</p>

<p>“The road is public property, I believe, sir!” she replied
in the same icy tone. “And I cannot prevent you,
if you force your presence on me. But if you were anything
but what you are—if you laid any pretence to
being a gentleman, you would spare me <i>the loathing of
your company</i>!”</p>

<p>I fell back then, indeed, as if she had struck me, and
without a word in reply I returned slowly to the sorrel’s
side and made pretence of tightening the girths with
fingers that were trembling.</p>

<p>This was her gratitude! This my reward! Yet I consoled
myself with the thought that even yet she would be
obliged to seek my assistance in remounting, and I determined
that I would not be the one to again make advances.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
But I did not know my lady, nor had I taken into consideration
the fact of the boulders scattered plentifully
around.</p>

<p>As with my back to her I fumbled at my saddle, I
heard the mare’s footsteps receding; and, turning
sharply, was in time to see her ladyship move slowly
away.</p>

<p>Erect in the saddle, with never a backward glance, she
urged the mare into a canter, breasted the green slope,
disappeared, and left me there in the sunlit hollow—alone!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>OF CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE ROSE GARDEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Neither</span> that day nor the following one did I again see
my lady. And if I yet retained some lingering hope of
her relenting in her old attitude towards me, I was
doomed to be disappointed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in pursuance of my duties many a visit I
paid to solitary farms and to the houses of the gentry
scattered along the coast; at some to meet with the respect
which my uniform and the nature of my errand
warranted; at others—and these for the most part belonging
to Catholic gentlemen—to encounter an ill-concealed
hostility that sufficiently testified with whom their
sympathies rested. And everywhere I found the same
brooding spirit of alarm and discontent. The whole
country was on the tiptoe of expectation. Rumours of
William’s defeat and death were freely circulated by
James’s infatuated followers. Scarcely a fisherman
upon the coast but who woke fully expecting to see a
French army drawn up upon the shore. Indeed, throughout
all the western counties the Jacobites were secretly
arming, awaiting but the success of the Stuart cause
in Ireland to kindle anew the flames of civil war.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of England in this, the month of
June, 1690. ’Twas some ten days after the incident in
the hollow that I again had speech of my lady. Intelligence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
had reached me of a rumoured landing of arms in
the neighbourhood of Teignmouth. Leaving De Brito,
therefore, and twenty men to guard the village, with the
remaining two-score troopers at my heels, I set out northwards.
Whether, for once, rumour had lied, or whether
the Jacobites had got wind of our presence I do not
know; but certain it is that though we lay all that day
and the next concealed in a beech wood near to the town
nothing occurred, nor did we see any sign of a vessel off
the coast.</p>

<p>On the third day, therefore, empty handed, we returned
to Cleeve. It was evening, when, dismissing the troopers
at the entrance gates, I rode up to the manor.</p>

<p>Seldom, I think, in all my wanderings have I witnessed
a more lovely night. Behind the torrs, in a golden glory
the sun was sinking to its rest, gilding the foliage of
the oaks with a dozen varying shades of orange, pink
and purple, and in the light of which the house before
me stood refulgent, as if ’twas bathed in lambent flame.</p>

<p>I rode slowly to the stables, and having seen my horse
safely stalled, I passed by way of the terrace to the
house.</p>

<p>The doors and windows stood wide open, for ’twas a
warm June night and the smoke curled lazily from the
tall chimneys into the still evening air; but there was no
other sign of life about it, and I entered and made my
way to the dining hall without encountering any one.</p>

<p>Here indeed, though I met with the same solitude, I
found a cold collation upon the oaken table, to the which
I readily applied myself, wondering the while at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
silence of the house and half wishing—such is man’s inconsistency—for
their ladyships’ presence. Once, my
eyes travelling through the open window, rested upon the
figure of a woman passing swiftly down one of the terrace
walks. But the distance and the gathering dusk left
me uncertain as to whether it was my lady or no.</p>

<p>Presently I rose and sauntered slowly through the gardens
to the cliffs; and here, upon the highest point, I
flung myself upon the grass and gazed in genuine admiration
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Long I lay there watching the lights spring up, one
by one, in the village below me, until the crimson glow
faded from the fleecy clouds above; then at last I rose
and slowly retraced my steps. As I passed through the
misty, scented gardens, idly culling the roses that lined
the pathway on either side, the bats were fluttering
around me on their silent wings, and faintly in the deepening
dusk came the hoot of wandering owls. Somewhere
in the trees around the house a nightingale poured forth
its flood of song, as slowly upon the quiet landscape fell
the peaceful stillness of the summer night.</p>

<p>Presently I saw upon my right a green arch of yew,
and passing beneath this, I came upon a spot the like
of which I have never seen to equal. Surely, I told myself,
this is my lady’s garden, and one well worthy to
match with her in point of loveliness. For it was a
veritable bower of roses—a smooth stretch of green
lawn, interspersed with beds of flowers of every conceivable
shade of colour. The thick yew hedge enclosing
it was cut in the stiff and formal manner of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Dutch, a fashion brought with William from The
Hague. In the centre stood a white marble fountain,
the jet from which fell with a pleasant plash into the
wide basin beneath. One side of this enclosure was fenced
by the low stone wall that ran above the moat, and facing
me, another leafy arch gave entrance to the terrace walk
beyond. Yet it was not admiration for the scene before
me that brought me to a sudden halt and caused my
heart to quicken its pulsations; for upon the broad
steps at the fountain foot a woman was seated with a canvas
in her hand, a brush and palette at her side. At
the sound of my footsteps she turned her head, and I
saw that it was my lady’s sister, Mistress Grace.</p>

<p>“Captain Cassilis,” she said with a winning smile, “saw
you ever a more lovely night? Alas! I fear that my poor
efforts fall far short of the reality. But you shall judge,
sir, of their merits for yourself.” And she held the canvas
out to me.</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at her in sheer astonishment.
Then with a beating heart I took the canvas in my hand;
for although she had not shown the same hostility
towards me that my lady had done, yet never before had
she addressed me of her own free will.</p>

<p>“You will let me see it?” I said humbly.</p>

<p>“You have been a great traveller, I believe, sir,” she
answered; “and therefore your opinion should carry
weight.</p>

<p>“But you do not speak!” I held the painting from me,
the better to observe it; though had it been the finest
masterpiece that Rome or Florence could produce, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
doubt if in that moment I had marked its beauty; for
my head was in a whirl. Was the barrier between myself
and these women to be broken down at last?</p>

<p>“Madam,” I replied hastily, “to say that it is beautiful,
is only——”</p>

<p>“To flatter me!” she interrupted quickly, as I hesitated,
racking my brains for a phrase she might not deem extravagant.
“And,” she continued lightly, “is it your custom,
sir, to judge of a picture’s excellence upside
down?”</p>

<p>“Madam,” I stammered in utter confusion, “I crave
your pardon——”</p>

<p>“Fie, sir!” she continued, smiling. “Do you not know
that to wound a woman’s vanity is to make an enemy for
life? And I had inferred,” she continued in the same
tone of raillery, glancing at the roses in my hand, “that
you were a lover of Nature yourself.”</p>

<p>“If, madam,” I said hesitatingly, “you would permit me
in some slight measure to retrieve my unfortunate error,
and would so far honour me as to accept this humble
tribute of my regret——”</p>

<p>“I love flowers,” she said simply, taking my proffered
gift and raising it to her face, perhaps to hide her
heightened colour.</p>

<p>“And I also,” I replied, looking down at her slight,
girlish figure, as with deft fingers she rearranged the
roses in her lap. “For to one fresh from the reeking
kennels of London, where pestilence stalks hand in hand
with crime, this old world garden where you live comes
as a glimpse of Eden.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Yet I have read, sir,” she said impulsively, “that every
Eden has its——”</p>

<p>She broke off abruptly without finishing the sentence;
and even in the dusk I saw the warm blood mantle to her
brow.</p>

<p>“Its serpent, you would say,” I said quietly, reading
her thoughts; “aye, madam?”</p>

<p>For a moment or two there was silence—a silence broken
only by the soft sound of the falling water and the voices
of the night. I glanced at the woman before me and
my heart sank. What a gulf there was between her life
and mine!</p>

<p>Presently she spoke.</p>

<p>“It was a thoughtless speech,” she said in a
low voice. “I pray you forget my hasty words.”</p>

<p>Again there was silence between us. But the memory
of my errand in this place, of my lady’s open scorn, and
of the haunting feeling of unrest that I had previously
felt recurred to me again with double force.</p>

<p>“You, at least, do not hate me, madam,” I said bitterly,
leaning upon the marble basin and gazing into the water
below.</p>

<p>“It may be that I have not my sister’s pride,” she answered
slowly, “or it may be that my nature is not
formed for hatred. And then—” she continued, bending
lower over the flowers, so that I could not see her face.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam?” I said inquiringly, as she paused.</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I am wrong,” she replied; “but I do
not think that you are happy here.”</p>

<p>“Happy?” I cried, startled out of my self-control.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
“God knows that I am not! Do you imagine that I have
no feeling? That it is pleasant for me to be shunned as
if I were a leper—unfit for human ken? But for your
kindly speech of me to-night, since first I came to Cleeve
I have encountered naught save contumely and cruel
words. Yet I would remind you, madam, that another in
my place might not have dealt with you so leniently.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed on my words—a silence
in which the woman before me rose to her feet, and, laying
the flowers that I had given her upon the fountain
rim, stooped to collect her scattered colours—a quick step
sounded on the terrace walk, and my lady’s figure appeared
beneath the arch of yew.</p>

<p>“Why, Gracie?” she cried gaily. The fountain was
between us—she had not discerned my presence. “I
have been seeking everywhere for you! And what is
this?” she continued, catching sight of the flowers, and
raising them to inhale their fragrant odour. “Roses?
Ah, now I understand! Cousin Rupert has been here,
and the painting, I fear me, was but a pretext!”</p>

<p>“Indeed but you are wrong!” Mistress Grace replied
with pretty confusion. “It was this gentleman who gave
them to me!”</p>

<p>At her words I stepped aside, and my lady and I were
face to face. It sent a swift pang to my heart to see
the sudden change upon her face. A moment before she
had been gay and smiling, but now, at sight of me the
smile was frozen on her lips, and the hand in which she
held the flowers fell to her side again. For it may be
twenty seconds thus we stood, her eyes hardening with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the pride I knew so well. Then she spoke. “It was
kind indeed of Captain Cassilis to give us of our own,”
she said coldly. “But in the house yonder there are of
flowers enough and yet to spare. And for your compassion,
sir, toward our fallen state, it may follow—these!”</p>

<p>She had been standing near to the wall that ran above
the moat, and now, suiting the action to her words, she
tossed the roses contemptuously into the black water
below.</p>

<p>“Come, Gracie,” she added, turning on her heel.</p>

<p>In a few strides I had barred her further progress.</p>

<p>“One moment, madam,” I said hoarsely; “I desire a
word with you.”</p>

<p>“The desire is not reciprocal, sir,” she answered icily.
“Permit me to pass.”</p>

<p>“Not until you have heard me, madam,” I cried desperately.
“Even the greatest of criminals can claim
so much right.”</p>

<p>“In that case,” she replied with bitter irony, “your
claim is indisputable. Say on, sir. We are but two unarmed
women here.”</p>

<p>For a moment, speechless, I stared at her, with the hot
blood flushing to my face. How this woman hated me!</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” she cried impatiently, “have you nothing
to say? No further insults for your prisoners?”</p>

<p>“Madam, madam!” I burst out passionately, “what have
I done to you that you should hate me so?”</p>

<p>“<i>Hate</i> you?” she answered slowly, gazing at me with
hard, cruel eyes. “I think that you mistake me, sir.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
You are too mean, too base a thing to hate. <i>I loathe
you!</i>”</p>

<p>And as with bent head, to hide the pain her words
caused me, I stood aside, without further notice, save,
indeed, one pitying glance from Mistress Grace, they
passed me by, and I heard their footsteps die away into
the night.</p>

<p>Long I remained where they had left me, my brain a
chaos, a tumult in my breast. The song of the nightingale
still quivered on the peaceful air, and the moon
rose high in the heavens, silvering the tops of the surrounding
oaks and flinging the shadows of their twisted
boles upon the grass. Yet still I lingered by the fountain,
in nowise conscious of the flight of time, whilst the
very leaves, whispering to the passing breeze, seemed but
to mock me with the echo of my lady’s words. Presently
my brain grew clearer. What was this woman to me that
I should imagine that her words could wound me? Or
what concern of mine the opinion that she held of me?
’Twas but a week or two at most, and Cleeve, its fortunes,
and its mistress would but linger in my memory—a vanished
dream. Or, at the most, the vision of my lady
would shine athwart the pathway of my chequered life,
like as a radiant star above my head shot suddenly across
the lighted heavens and vanished in illimitable space.</p>

<p>With a grim smile and a firm step I made my way to the
house. Arrived in the hall, however, a surprise awaited
me. Within the main entrance, seeming to fill the doorway,
and conversing with my lady in low tones, stood the
formidable figure of Sampson Dare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>The actual words I could not catch, but of the failure
of his mission I could readily guess, both by his dejected
face and also by the fact that at the sound of my footstep
my lady turned swiftly away, and with bent head and
averted face passed up the oaken stair. When the last
rustle of her skirts had died away I slowly crossed the
hall.</p>

<p>“Well, my friend,” I said, addressing the giant before
me, not wisely, I admit, “what news of London?”</p>

<p>He scowled at me for a moment without speaking, then
bending suddenly, he thrust his face within a foot of
mine, and I felt his hot breath on my cheek.</p>

<p>“Hark you!” he growled hoarsely, opening and shutting
his great hands, “but for my orders I would twist
your neck and think no more of it than if I killed a rat!”</p>

<p>“Tush, man!” I made answer, meeting his gaze firmly,
though I confess I was considerably startled at his
words, for well I knew that once within his iron grip,
the man had strength to carry out his threat, “and
bring the troopers down upon the house? You should
best know in that case what consideration your mistress
would be like to meet with at their hands. No, no,” I
continued coolly, twisting my moustaches, “I give you
credit for more sense than that, unless, indeed, your
body’s growth has dwarfed your brain.”</p>

<p>His face had fallen at my words. I suppose he saw
their wisdom, but he still regarded me with a look of vindictive
hatred.</p>

<p>“So you shelter yourself behind the women, do
you?” he said at length. “Very well, Master Chicken-heart!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> 
Only, should it happen that they cannot shield
you——”</p>

<p>“In that event, my friend,” I answered, lightly tapping
the butt of the pistol in my sash, “the bigger the
bulk, the easier the mark. You understand?” And without
further words I left him. But that night on retiring
to my chamber, for the first time I took the precaution
of sounding all the walls and flooring with my
sword, and having assured myself as to the non-existence
of a secret entrance, I placed my sword and pistols within
easy reach of my hand; for with so resolute a man now
at her bidding, I was by no means certain that my lady
might not attempt some desperate scheme against me.
Nay, as I stood at the open window gazing across the
woods to where the moonlight fell upon the old church
tower and the slumbering hamlet below, I was minded
for the moment to transfer my quarters to the village
inn. But shame at such a course kept me to my post,
and I flung myself at last upon my couch, conscious that
the day had brought to me another formidable antagonist,
a relentless foe.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, therefore, it is not to be wondered
at that I slept but ill, or that it was with a distinct
feeling of relief I awoke from a troubled slumber
to hear the distant clock upon the church strike five.</p>

<p>I sprang from my couch and set the window wide. By
my faith! ’twas a morning to put heart in any man.
The fresh sea breeze stole softly through the casement,
fragrant with the scent of opening flowers. Overhead a
few fleecy clouds drifted idly beneath a dome of deepest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
blue, whilst in the gardens below me, flooded by the summer
sunshine, gorgeous butterflies on painted wings
flitted above the dew-bespangled grass.</p>

<p>As, lost in thought, I leaned upon the sill, the fancy for
a swim in the distant, murmuring sea commended itself
so strongly to my mind that, hastily dressing, I took my
sheathed sword beneath my arm and descended the stairs.
No one was as yet abroad, and all was silent in the house
when I quietly unbarred the outer door and stepped upon
the terrace. And now that I was in the open air, my
courage, that had somewhat waned the night before, returned
to me. I laughed at the fears that then had power
to shake me, and I told myself with a thrill of pardonable
pride that over all this fair domain and that which it contained
I was the master, and would prove my power. But
on arrival at the cliffs my exultation suffered a sudden
check, for I had scarcely set foot upon the narrow path
when my eyes, travelling to the beach below, fell upon
that which caused me to fling myself down upon the grass
and to peer cautiously over the edge of the cliff; for in
the little bay beneath, a boat, urged by a single pair of
oars, was rapidly approaching to the land. Presently
it grounded on the shingle, and in the solitary occupant
who sprang ashore I recognised the figure of Sampson
Dare. He beached the boat high and dry above the receding
tide, and, stooping, took from thence a lantern
and a cloak. This done, he straightened his back, and,
unconscious of the watcher overhead, shading his eyes,
stood looking out to sea. What in the name of mystery
was the man doing here—here at this early hour, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
lantern in his hand? Clearly, the very fact of this
proved that he had been out all night. Yet for what
was he watching now? Or what did the man expect?</p>

<p>And suddenly the answer came, for the thick haze that
had hitherto hung upon the surface of the water was
rapidly dissipating beneath the sun’s increasing power,
and as with its disappearance the prospect widened,
away out at sea, some two miles distant, I caught sight
of the dark hull of a small vessel with a cloud of white
canvas above, looking for all the world like some great
seabird riding on the wave.</p>

<p>Short time had I to note her appearance, however, for
even as I gazed the helm swung round, and heading for
the open sea, she vanished in the golden mist beyond.</p>

<p>Not till then did the figure of the man below me turn
and with a quick step ascend the beach. And seeing this,
I quickly withdrew, concealing myself among the shrubs,
where I could command both a view of the path by which
he must come and also of the house itself, and setting myself
to wait for what should follow.</p>

<p>And presently my patience was rewarded, for on arriving
within sight of the house, at the beginning of the
sloping lawns, he came to a sudden halt, and after closely
scanning its windows, fell to pacing up and down the
grass. Nor had he long to wait before the door by
which I had left the house suddenly opened and my lady
herself stepped forth into the light.</p>

<p>At sight of her the man again advanced, and they met
upon the little bridge above the moat, that, as it were,
divided all the gardens from the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>What my lady was saying to him, or that the fact of the
door being unbolted had caused her some uneasiness, I
could not but shrewdly guess; for they both turned to
look up at my open window. And I saw the big man lay
his hand upon the long rapier at his side with a gesture
that boded ill for me should my presence be discovered,
and set me crouching closer in the bushes, cursing my
scarlet coat and heavy military boots that compelled me
to remain in my concealment, from which I could neither
advance nor retreat. Yet the entrance to the rose garden
lay but some dozen feet away; if, I thought, as they
turned once more and came towards the place where I lay,
that was their goal, then surely my ears were keen
enough to give me the key to this mystery. That it was
a plot with which my fate was somehow connected I did
not doubt; the presence of the vessel alone confirmed my
opinion, and I awaited with a beating heart for their approach.</p>

<p>But again, I confess, I did not know my lady, and I
could not but admire her caution, for when within thirty
feet of where I lay, on a sudden she turned sharply aside,
and leading the way to the very centre of the open lawns,
careless of whether I should see them together, they
sauntered slowly up and down in earnest conversation.
Of the nature of this latter I could only guess, but in the
added sparkle of my lady’s eye, in the prouder poise of
her lovely head, I read all the signs of a settled purpose,
of indomitable will.</p>

<p>They parted eventually at the little bridge, the big
man evidently receiving some instructions, for he nodded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
repeatedly, and strode off in the direction of the
stables.</p>

<p>After he had disappeared my lady still remained leaning,
lost in thought, against the low stone parapet. But
if, as I now believe, she had a suspicion of my presence
near, why then ’twas well conceived, for while she was
there I dared not move, and thus the time was gained for
Sampson Dare to speed upon his errand.</p>

<p>’Twas full five minutes ere she roused herself, and then,
with a searching glance over the sunny gardens, turning
on her heel, she walked slowly to the house.</p>

<p>It was not until the door had closed upon her that I
ventured from my hiding place, and stealthily making a
wide detour, for I would not have her deem that I had
played the spy, came out upon the avenue before the
house. Passing thence to the stables, I found my suspicions
considerably strengthened, for Sampson Dare
was nowhere to be seen, and the powerful grey that he
bestrode was missing from its stall.</p>

<p>But if the events of the morning left me in some perplexity,
they left me also alert and on my guard to face
the threatened danger, and I returned slowly to the
house, fully determined to probe the secret to its core.
I spent the morning, therefore, in hanging about the
house and stables, seeking for something that would
enable me to form a clue. But nothing occurred, nor did
Sampson Dare again return, and reluctantly I owned
myself completely baffled.</p>

<p>Towards noon, grown weary of inactivity, I mounted
my horse with the intention of riding to the village, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
I had got no further than the gates of the manor when
I was startled by the sound of a cavalry trumpet echoing
amongst the torrs.</p>

<p>Shading my eyes with my hand, I gazed down the
valley. Upon the winding road from Exeter, and still
some two miles distant, I saw the scarlet coats and glittering
accoutrements of a regiment of horse upon the
march. And upon the leading files approaching nearer,
I was no less surprised to recognise my own comrades
of the Tangier Horse. At the sight I turned the sorrel’s
head, drove in my spurs, and rode down to meet the
approaching column. I received a hearty welcome from
my fellow-officers, and a few minutes later I was riding
side by side with Colonel Savage, a man as much disliked
and feared as was the brutal Kirke himself.</p>

<p>In answer to the questions that he put to me, I gave
him a brief account of my adventures, omitting much,
however, relating to my lady; for the coarse jests of the
men around me upon the nature of my present duty
grated with an unwonted distaste upon my ear.</p>

<p>Yet these were the men with whom I had been content
to ruffle it with the best—nay, even to be looked upon as
a sort of leader, on the reputation of my swordsmanship.
I, a gentleman of family! At the thought a
sudden rush of shame pervaded me.</p>

<p>“So this is Cleeve,” the colonel said abruptly. We had
reached the entrance gates. “I would I had the harrying
of yonder dove cot. But that my orders to advance admit
of no delay I would visit it as in the days of ’88.”</p>

<p>’Twas my turn now to do the questioning, and in reply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
he told me they were bound for Plymouth, whither every
soldier in the county was being hurried, since the French
fleet, under Tourville, was hovering off the coast and a
descent upon the town was daily expected. Also, that in
Ireland affairs had reached a crisis. William, with an
army of not less than thirty thousand men, was in full
march southwards; whilst James had retreated from his
camp at Dundalk and thrown himself into Drogheda. It
was expected that a battle would be fought in the immediate
vicinity of Dublin.</p>

<p>All this and more—for of the doings of the outer world
I had but scanty news—he told me as we rode; so that it
was with surprise I found that we had reached the outskirts
of the village. A deep frown gathered on the
colonel’s face as at our appearance the troopers hastened
from the houses.</p>

<p>“The rogues grow lazy,” he said grimly. “I will
promise them no lack of work between here and
Plymouth.”</p>

<p>“Plymouth?” I said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered quickly. “Do you suppose that I
can leave three-score troopers rotting here when every
man is needed in the south?”</p>

<p>“But——” I began in some dismay.</p>

<p>“There is no ‘but’ about it,” he said impatiently. “My
orders are strict. Nevertheless, I will strain a point in
your favour. You shall have a dozen men.”</p>

<p>“A dozen men?” I cried incredulously—“a dozen men
to guard this place?”</p>

<p>“And that is ten too many,” he replied. “What? Are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
you afraid of a set of country clodpoles, who could not
tell a sabre from a scythe?”</p>

<p>“Yet even a scythe may form a dangerous weapon, as
Sedgemoor proved,” I said tartly.</p>

<p>“Bah!” he replied contemptuously. We were dismounting
in the courtyard of the inn as he spoke. “’Tis not
like you, Cassilis, to reckon odds. A pity, indeed, if a
dozen men cannot order a parcel of beer-swilling clowns,
who would scuttle to their burrows fast enough at the
snapping of a pistol. But who the devil have we here?”</p>

<p>I looked up quickly at the words. We were approaching
the steps in a body when the door of the inn suddenly
opened and a man came hastily out.</p>

<p>He was dressed in riding costume, and as he halted in
surprise at sight of us, I saw that it was the young
baronet, my lady’s cousin.</p>

<p>“Permit me, colonel,” I said, stepping forward, “to
bring to your acquaintance Sir Rupert Courtenay, of
Clevedon Hall.”</p>

<p>“Courtenay?” said the colonel, frowning. “I knew a
Courtenay years ago in Flanders.”</p>

<p>“My father fell at Teneffe,” the young baronet replied
with visible impatience.</p>

<p>“What?” cried the other heartily. “You are the son
of Richard Courtenay—‘Fighting Dick’ we called him—my
old comrade in arms? The most rampant Papist
and prince of good fellows that ever drew sword from
scabbard. Aye, aye! I can trace the likeness now. But
’tis no place for discussion, this. You will join us
within.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>“Your pardon,” stammered the young man, who, I could
not help seeing, was considerably embarrassed at his
words, “but—there is an appointment——”</p>

<p>“With a woman, I’ll warrant,” the colonel said quickly;
then noticing the flush upon the other’s face: “Tchut!
women will keep. And I will even hold you my prisoner
for the time and so preserve you from temptation. Nay,
I will take no denial, sir,” he continued peremptorily.
“You shall share the honours of our table, and we will
crack a bottle to your father’s memory.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the whole party followed them to the inn
parlour, whither the landlord was speedily summoned to
attend their wants. But as for me, in the confusion
caused by our arrival I passed unnoticed from the room
and left the inn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>OF THE DUEL IN THE WOOD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span>, however, in the open air I paused; and then,
with no fixed intention in my mind, I slowly crossed the
yard and peered in at the open stable; and here, indeed,
a surprise awaited me, for a horse, which I recognized as
belonging to the young baronet, and upon which he had
twice visited the manor, was standing unsaddled in the
nearest stall.</p>

<p>Wrapped in thought, I stood staring at the animal before
me. From the inn came a confused babel of voices,
the clatter of crockery, the clink of cups, and now and
again a burst of laughter. But to all this I gave no heed,
for my brain was thinking deeply. What was Sir
Rupert Courtenay doing here? And, seeing that he
lived but some three miles distant, for Clevedon Hall was
the old mansion I had seen from the summit of Cleevesborough
nestling in the trees, what purpose could he
have in putting up his horse at the village inn? That he
was bound for the manor I did not doubt. But would
any man forsake his horse at the village to walk the
remainder of the way on foot? The idea was preposterous.
And then I remembered his confusion at the
colonel’s words, and the appointment he had mentioned,
and a sudden light broke on me, and all was plain. He
had come to meet my lady, was in her confidence, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
sharer of her schemes! Dolt that I was, not to have
thought of it before! He had come to meet my lady—but
where?</p>

<p>A few moments thought, and it flashed upon me like an
inspiration.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the village, where the parkland surrounding
the manor ceased and the first scattered houses
of the street began, parallel with the road, a narrow
winding path ran through the woods. I had stumbled
upon it by accident when first I came to Cleeve, and
though I fancied it was seldom used, save by the servants
of the manor in their errands to and from the village,
’twas an ideal spot, I vow, in which to hold a tryst.
Aye, and as the memory of it grew upon me the very spot
itself was mirrored clear before my eyes.</p>

<p>At one place in the wood, where the pathway widened to
an open clearing, a little rustic bridge was thrown across
a stream. ’Twas here, if anywhere, that they were like
to meet. If only I could make my way to this spot unperceived
and conceal myself in the vicinity, it was more
than likely that I should learn the meaning of these
mysteries. True, ’twas not an honourable part to play
eavesdropper, but I consoled myself for what misgivings
I had upon the subject with the thought that all was fair
in war, and that if the part was thus forced upon me,
why, ’twas my lady herself who was to blame for it.</p>

<p>With my resolution formed, I roused myself for action.
I knew that for the execution of my project I had time
to spare, for I was well assured, however urgent were
his orders to advance, the colonel would not yet release<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
his guest. Accordingly, unnoticed by any one within, I
passed across the yard and gained the village street,
threading my way between groups of men and horses,
until I stumbled at length upon the man I sought, the
one-eyed sergeant of my troop, and to him I gave instructions
to secure my horse and to choose a dozen men
on whom he could rely, and with these, upon the regiment’s
departure, to take possession of the inn and to
await my further orders.</p>

<p>He saluted in return, and I watched his burly figure
go clanking down the street. Then satisfied that I had
at least one tried and cunning soldier to uphold me, I
continued on my way.</p>

<p>When I had left the village behind me and had reached
the woods, I turned sharply to the right, and at a distance
of some two hundred yards from the road I came to
the entrance of the little path. As I stepped into the
cool shadow of the trees, I paused irresolutely, as a sudden
thought struck me. What if it was not my lady he
had come to meet, but Mistress Grace! I had seen
enough with my own eyes to convince me that there was
a warmer feeling existing between them than mere
cousinly affection. Was all my cunning scheme to end
in witnessing a lover’s meeting?</p>

<p>Almost I had persuaded myself that this was indeed
the case, and I was strongly tempted to retrace my steps.
But the memory of the dark, mysterious vessel I had seen
deterred me from my purpose, and again I set my face
resolutely towards the house, and at the next turning
in the path I came upon something by which my ardour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
was considerably stimulated, for fluttering from a
thorn bush beside the track was a shred of scarlet
cloth.</p>

<p>I took this tell-tale witness in my hand and closely examined
it. It was of the same material as the coat I
wore, and had been but recently torn from its wearer, for
now that I gazed about me, my suspicions roused, in a
patch of moist turf at my feet I saw the fresh print of a
man’s spurred heel. I gazed eagerly ahead; but the
pathway so wound and twisted that I could not see a
dozen feet before me—only the hot sun slanted through
the leaves above and fell upon the thickets of brier, and
bush and bracken that walled me in on either side with a
hedge of emerald green.</p>

<p>I listened, but no sound reached my ear save the hum of
insect life around me and the sough of the wind in the
whispering trees. Yet who was the man who had recently
passed along this path? And why should a
trooper be wandering in the woods?</p>

<p>The more I thought of this, the more it puzzled me. I
could hazard no conjecture as to the man’s identity, still
less as to his purpose. Only, with a growing uneasiness,
I loosened my sword in its sheath and advanced more
cautiously, searching the bushes on either side.</p>

<p>It may have been for some quarter of a mile I had proceeded
thus when, upon drawing near to the little clearing,
on a sudden I heard the sound of a man’s deep voice
and a woman’s startled cry.</p>

<p>At the sound I slipped amongst the bushes on my left,
and forcing my way through their tangled growth, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the turning of the path I parted the leafy screen before
me and gazed across the little clearing.</p>

<p>Two figures met my eyes. In the woman standing with
her back to me I had no difficulty in recognising my lady;
but, dazzled by the sunlight, I was forced to look twice
at the man who faced her at the head of the bridge, barring
her progress—the man dressed in the uniform of
the Tangier Horse—ere I clearly perceived his features.
It was De Brito!</p>

<p>De Brito! The sight of him came as a revelation to me.
For at once I remembered that I had not seen him at the
village when the regiment rode in, though in the incidents
following our arrival this fact had escaped my memory.
But the explanation of his presence in the manor woods I
had yet to learn, and I bent my attention on the scene before
me.</p>

<p>What had already passed between them I could
only guess, but my lady was now speaking.</p>

<p>“Are you aware, sir, that this is private ground?” she
said clearly.</p>

<p>“Private?” De Brito answered mockingly. “Aye, aye!
A sweet spot for a meeting. But seeing that the recreant
lover is but a laggard, why, you should thank me, mistress,
that I am here to take his place.”</p>

<p>“Whoever you may be I do not know,” my lady answered,
her figure trembling with surprise and passion,
“but be assured of this, your insolence to me shall not
go long unpunished. And now, stand aside.”</p>

<p>“Oho! you think to frighten me with fine words, do you,
madam?” he sneered, his evil smile replaced by an ugly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
frown. “Not so fast, my dainty dove; you came hither
for your own pleasure, you will remain awhile for mine.”</p>

<p>“Let me pass,” my lady replied, advancing boldly
towards him.</p>

<p>But she had mistaken her man. Instead of giving place
to her, he took two steps forward and gripped her wrists.</p>

<p>“You shall pass fast enough, mistress,” he said roughly,
“but first I will even take toll of those ripe lips; for
who passes, pays.” And despite her struggles he strove
to draw her towards him. Up till now I had remained
a silent spectator of the scene; nay, I had even felt a
thrill of satisfaction that my lady should see that not
every one would treat her with the same forbearance that
I had shown towards her; but when he laid hands upon
her a sudden flame of anger took possession of me, and
I sprang into the open space.</p>

<p>“You hound!” I cried.</p>

<p>At my words, releasing his hold upon my lady’s wrists,
he stepped backwards, a circumstance of which I was
not slow to take advantage by placing myself between
him and the bridge. But his surprise once mastered, he
faced me with a lowering brow.</p>

<p>“So,” he said sneeringly after a moment’s pause, “the
recreant lover arrives. Now I understand, and I congratulate
you, mistress, on your choice.”</p>

<p>“You fool!” was all I could stammer, so taken aback
was I at his words; “what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“What I say,” he answered in the same sneering tone.
“We were blind not to have suspected it before. ’Tis
not the first time a pretty face has caused a man to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
change sides. And I come between you, do I?” he continued
darkly. “I am a spoil-sport, am I? Yours, and
that——”</p>

<p>I checked the foul word on his lips by a blow that sent
him reeling backwards, when, his spurred heel catching
in a projecting root, he fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>Throughout the foregoing scene my lady had remained
standing in the same spot, as if doubtful what course to
take.</p>

<p>“Go, madam,” I said quietly, unsheathing my sword
and placing myself to cover her retreat, though without
daring to take my eyes from the man before me.</p>

<p>As the latter rose slowly to his feet I heard my lady’s
receding footsteps cross the bridge and die away upon
the woodland path, and in another minute I had need
of all my skill to meet the attack of the man before me,
for with a furious oath he drew his sword and flung
himself upon me, and our blades met to the sound of the
music that I loved so well.</p>

<p>From the first I read murder in his eyes, and so fierce,
indeed, was his attack that I was driven back to the bank
of the stream; and it was only when I felt myself upon
the very edge of this that I realised my danger. I dared
not turn my head, but instinctively I knew that one step
backwards and I should fall some four feet to the bed
of the stream, where, penned between its narrow banks,
I was practically at my opponent’s mercy, and what form
this latter would take I read all too clearly in his blood-shot
eyes. He saw his advantage, too, for with a short
cry of triumph he redoubled his efforts, so that I tottered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
on the very brink. But his very confidence of success
was like to have been his undoing, for rallying myself
with the courage of despair, I parried his furious lunges
and thrust so shrewdly in return that I laid his cheek
open from brow to chin.</p>

<p>Startled for a moment by the suddenness of the attack,
and blinded by the blood that sprang freely from the
wound, he threw himself violently backward, thus
narrowly escaping the second thrust with which I followed
up my advantage.</p>

<p>But the respite thus afforded me was sufficient. I
sprang lightly aside and renewed the fight upon more
equal terms. Once, indeed, we paused as if by mutual
consent, and faced each other with dripping brows and
labouring breath. But in a few moments’ time we fell
to it again, and the glade resounded to the rasping of
our blades, that thrust and parried, twined and clicked
together like sentient things of evil; whilst the sun lay
hot upon the clearing and the birds flew chattering from
the surrounding woods. And once again I narrowly
escaped with my life, for as we circled round each other
I stumbled over the very root that had previously caused
his downfall, and though I sprang instantly aside, so
near was the fierce thrust that he aimed at me that his
point shredded the cambric at my throat.</p>

<p>Up till now I had been acting mostly on the defensive,
but roused by this last attack to sudden passion, and conscious
of a thin trickle of blood upon my breast that
warned me how near had been my peril, I called all my
skill to my aid and began to press him in my turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>And from that moment the aspect of the fight altered,
for good sword though the man was, his intemperate
habits were against him, and whereas, minute by minute,
as the fight proceeded I felt myself growing cooler and
settled more steadily to my work, the sweat gathered
thicker on his brow and his chest heaved in panting
breaths to his exertions. Thickset as the man was, and
like a bull for strength, I felt his thrusts momentarily
grow weaker, and foot by foot I pressed him backwards
across the open space—back until he could retreat no
further by reason of the encircling trees; and then,
as I felt his pressure on my blade diminish, twice I drove
him round the little clearing. Nor for all his renewed
efforts could he make headway against me or even hold
his ground.</p>

<p>Once he rallied, twice he rallied, but my wrist was iron
and I would not be denied. And with my glittering point
ever at his breast, looking into my grim face, I think he
tasted then the bitterness of death. Think? Nay, I
know. I could read in his dilated eyes, in the snarling,
blood-streaked lips, that reminded me of naught so much
as of a trapped wolf, that he realised that he was
mastered. The man was no coward, as I knew, but reading
my purpose by his own, small blame to him that the
shadow of doom gathered upon his face, or that as for a
third time I drove him before me, a low groan escaped
his lips.</p>

<p>“Curse you!” he gasped hoarsely, parrying wildly;
“finish it, and be——”</p>

<p>And even as he spoke the end came, for putting aside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
a still wilder thrust, I slipped within his guard and
wounded him in the wrist.</p>

<p>At that the sword fell from his nerveless fingers, and
staggering to the nearest tree, he leaned against its
knotted trunk, while the blood dripped steadily upon the
grass and his breath came in long-drawn, labouring sobs.
And at this moment from the direction of the village the
trumpets of the regiment sounded the “assembly.” The
sound was wafted clearly to our ears upon the breeze,
and I saw De Brito start and straighten himself ere
turning to me with a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said hoarsely, “what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>For answer I pushed his sword towards him with my
foot.</p>

<p>“There is your sword,” I said shortly, “and the regiment
is in the village. You should know as well as I the
meaning of that trumpet call. For the rest, Señor
de Brito, I am glad that our paths lie for the present
wide apart.”</p>

<p>Still for a moment he glowered on me, relief struggling
with hate upon his face. Then he stooped and raised
his sword.</p>

<p>“You are a fool,” he said slowly, sheathing his blade
and hastily twisting a handkerchief round his wounded
wrist. “A while ago I should have killed you without
scruple.”</p>

<p>“I am not an assassin,” I said coldly.</p>

<p>“On your head be it, then,” he answered sneeringly.
“Only the matter does not end here, and if you live
long enough there shall yet be a heavy reckoning between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
us. No, curse you!” he added with sudden passion,
“you have not seen the last of Heitor de Brito.” And
with a look of baffled hate, he turned upon his heel.
Long after the sound of his footsteps had died away in
the woods I stood where he had left me, pondering upon
the events of the last half hour.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was only when from the village there came
another long-drawn blast sounding the “advance” that
I roused myself to a sense of my surroundings. Then
sheathing my sword, I quenched my burning thirst at
the stream, and having freely bathed my face and hands
and ascertained that the wound upon my neck was a
mere scratch—scarce more than skin deep, indeed—I
turned to leave the spot. Yet now that the fierce excitement
of the moment was past and had given place to the
inevitable reaction, I began to ask myself what I had
gained by championing my lady’s cause, and to count
the cost of my interference. What was it to me that
she should meet with insult, or that for her sake I
should make for myself a ruthless enemy?</p>

<p>My present position was by no means so secure as I
could have wished it to be. Here was I isolated from
all assistance in this out-of-the-way village, with but a
dozen troopers at my back, in the midst of a people
notoriously hostile to us, and, for all I knew, a whole
regiment of Jacobites in the vessel I had seen in the
bay. The prospect was not encouraging.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_146">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_146.jpg" alt="He leaned against its knotted trunk">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“He leaned against its knotted trunk, while the blood
dripped steadily upon the grass”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And upon reaching the village I had an example of the
effect that the presence of so small a number of my men
remaining there produced, in the altered demeanour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
the villagers themselves; for whereas before they had
scarcely dared to show themselves in the street, now upon
every doorstep and in the open space before the inn excited
groups were gathered, above which sounded the
shrill voices of the women and the low muttering of the
men.</p>

<p>This clamour, indeed, fell to silence as I passed, but was
renewed with double vehemence when my back was
turned. To this, however, I paid no heed, but looking
neither to the right nor left, I strode down the street,
the excited groups making way for me readily enough
at the sight of my grim visage and clanking sword.</p>

<p>I found that the sergeant had faithfully carried out my
orders by withdrawing with his party to the inn, for I
deemed that this latter building was the most capable
of being held by a dozen resolute men in the event of
their being besieged, though that fate should play them
so scurvy a trick I did not anticipate.</p>

<p>Still, I determined that I would give my lady no single
loophole by which she might contrive to outwit me. So
true is it that a fool will pride himself on his acuteness
even in the midst of his folly, though this lesson was
more fully inculcated on my mind by subsequent events.</p>

<p>Conformable to the plan that I had conceived in my own
brain, I took the sergeant aside and warned him to be
strictly on his guard against surprise, arranging that
two pistol shots in rapid succession should be the mutual
signal of danger between us. But so comfortable was the
aspect of the inn parlour, of which the troopers had
already taken possession, and the welcome sight of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
familiar uniforms with their reassuring air of security,
that again I was sorely tempted to remove my quarters
thither also. Surely it was my pride only that prevented
me.</p>

<p>Glancing through the open window, I saw a trooper
bringing my horse from the stable, and again I cautioned
the sergeant to look well to the safety of their
own animals and to make certain that the liquor with
which the troopers were served had not been previously
tampered with.</p>

<p>“No fear of that,” he said with a grin, pointing to two
unopened casks of ale which they had already rolled
into the room. “He will be a clever man who touches
that whilst we are present.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I could see that although as a soldier he
was inclined to look down upon the villagers as a set of
ignorant rustics, he was visibly impressed on hearing of
the vessel I had seen, and I believed that I could trust
him to look well to the safety of his party. With a few
parting words to the men themselves, I mounted my
horse and rode away.</p>

<p>Again as I clattered up the street I was the mark of
all eyes, but I fancied that the groups showed more reluctance
to make way for me.</p>

<p>At the door of the blacksmith’s forge, round which
were gathered some dozen of the hardiest men left in
the village, I caught sight of Sampson Dare, towering
a head and shoulders above the rest, and at the same
moment his eyes met mine with a glance full of menace
and defiance there was no mistaking. Yet I made as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
I did not see, and in accordance with my assumed air
of indifference, with hand on hip and lightly humming
a little air, I passed them by and so rode slowly to the
manor. But here I could gain no information that would
enlighten me upon the events of the day, though I spent
an hour in pacing the terrace walks, keeping a watchful
eye upon the house. From there I made my way to the
cliffs; but though I gazed eagerly seawards, I could see
no trace of the mysterious vessel of the morning. To the
horizon the surface of the sea was bare of any sail.</p>

<p>Again I returned to the house, half hoping that I might
yet find my lady waiting to tender me her thanks for
the service I had rendered her in the wood.</p>

<p>But again I was disappointed; my lady was nowhere to
be seen. And a few hours later that happened which
drove all speculation upon her conduct from my mind.
It was drawing towards ten of the clock, and I was lingering
at the table after my evening meal, when I was
startled by a loud and prolonged knocking proceeding
from the direction of the main entrance.</p>

<p>So urgent, indeed, was the clamour that I sprang instantly
to my feet, and thrusting the pistols which I kept
ever handy into my sash, I caught up my sword and
hurried into the hall. And this indeed so quickly, that
ere any of the servants had reached the spot I had flung
open the massive door.</p>

<p>Outside in the dusk was one of the troopers. He was
panting heavily as if he had been running.</p>

<p>The sight of his face confirmed my forebodings.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I cried quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“The horses!” he gasped.</p>

<p>“The horses?” I repeated sharply. “What of them?
Speak, man!”</p>

<p>“Are gone!” he continued, leaning against the door
post.</p>

<p>“Gone?” I cried incredulously. “Gone? Do you mean
to tell me, man, that they could remove a dozen horses
from the stable, from beneath your open windows, without
you seeing them? You were drunk, you knaves!” I
said fiercely.</p>

<p>“It is not true,” he answered sullenly, recovering his
breath somewhat. “And for the stable, ’tis a wooden
shed. They had removed the boards at back—and the
stalls are empty. But that is not all. For Long Marsden——”</p>

<p>“Aye!” I cried impatiently. “What of him?”</p>

<p>“He had gone to see how they fared, and——”</p>

<p>“Is missing, too?”</p>

<p>“No,” he answered slowly; “he is not missing; but——”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” I cried, grasping the fellow’s arm so
that he winced.</p>

<p>“In the stocks!” he replied.</p>

<p>“In the stocks?”</p>

<p>I stepped back a pace or two and gazed at the man in
blank astonishment.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he added hastily. “He had been stunned as he
entered the stable door. Ten minutes later we found him
with a broken head in the stocks, and the key is missing!”</p>

<p>Still I could do nothing but stare stupidly at the fellow,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
until the silence following his words was broken
by a low laugh from behind me. I turned quickly at the
sound.</p>

<p>In the doorway upon my left, and so close that she must
have heard every word between us, stood my lady. And
at the sight of her a sudden rage possessed me.</p>

<p>“So, madam!” I cried passionately. “I believe I have
to thank you for this.”</p>

<p>I could not make out her face clearly, for she stood in
the shadow of the doorway—only her white-robed figure
and her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>“For what, sir?” she replied in a voice in which amusement
struggled with contempt. “For stealing your
horses?”</p>

<p>“That and this other outrage!” I continued, striving to
hide my mortification, and succeeding, I fear, but ill.
“’Twas done by your orders and you know by whom.”</p>

<p>Again she laughed mockingly, a laugh that stung me
worse than any words of scorn.</p>

<p>“Would you question me as to their names, sir—with the
flame of a candle?” she replied. “I have heard that is
a gentle method of yours!” I remembered the sergeant’s
threat to the steward, and I coloured hotly at her words.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I answered when I could speak, “for I
should as little expect truth from your lips as I should
look to you for gratitude!” And without further words
I turned and, closely followed by the trooper, ran down
the steps.</p>

<p>Once in the road, however, I was forced to restrain my
impatience and to slacken my pace, for the man beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
me was little used to running, and, moreover, was exhausted
by his previous exertions. I questioned him
closely, therefore, as to the details of what had passed.
From this I gathered that just before their supper was
served the man whom they called Long Marsden had
taken a lantern and stepped across to the stables to see
that all was safe there, as one or other of the men had
done at short intervals throughout the evening. That at
first his absence caused no uneasiness, but when ten minutes
had elapsed and he did not return, their suspicions
were aroused, and two of their number were sent to look
for him. That they found the stable door bolted on the
inside, and upon this being forced open, they found a
great gap in the back wall of the shed, where half a dozen
boards had been removed and the horses gone. More,
the lantern lay upon the ground and a thin trail of
blood led through the opening. This they had followed
round the adjacent buildings until they came to the
square before the inn. Here, in the shadow of the court-house,
they saw a dark mass huddled in the village
stocks, which proved to be the body of the missing
trooper. He was quite insensible, and was bleeding
freely from a gash upon the forehead; and the stocks being
secured by a heavy padlock, all their efforts to force
it had proved unavailing.</p>

<p>And all this, be it understood, had happened within a
hundred feet of the inn.</p>

<p>“But did you see no one, man?” I said at length.</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” he replied. “The place might be
deserted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>And upon reaching the village, I found this last statement
fully verified; for the street lay empty and silent
under the moon. Not a light showed in any of the houses
on either side. All was darkness and silence.</p>

<p>And rendered even more uneasy by this ominous silence
than by the open clamour of a few hours previous, I
passed hastily up the street to where the moonlight fell
upon a group of scarlet-coated figures gathered round
the framework of the stocks.</p>

<p>As I approached the sergeant detached himself from the
group and came to meet me.</p>

<p>“He is coming to,” he said briefly, saluting.</p>

<p>I said no word to him, good or bad; but as they made
way for me in silence, I knelt down by the side of the unfortunate
trooper. He was half conscious, indeed, and
moaned frequently as if in pain. A brief examination
showed me that his wound was not so serious as it had at
first appeared, and that it was more from the shock of
the blow that the man was suffering. I next turned my
attention to the stocks themselves. The upper or sliding
portion was fastened to the lower by an iron hasp and
staple, through the latter of which passed a heavy padlock,
strong enough to resist all the efforts of the
troopers’ swords.</p>

<p>Presently I rose to my feet.</p>

<p>“Six of you follow me,” I said shortly. And I turned
and walked swiftly back to the blacksmith’s cottage.</p>

<p>Upon the door of this latter I rapped loudly with the
hilt of my sword. The noise went echoing down the
silent street, and we stood waiting for what should follow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Nevertheless it was fully three minutes before a window
above was opened and a man thrust out his head.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he said in a sleepy voice—assumed,
I had no doubt. And I recognized him as one of
the men whom I had seen with Sampson Dare.</p>

<p>“You!” I answered sharply. “To come down and open
the door!”</p>

<p>“Open the door?” he answered. “A likely thing that!
Who be you who come disturbing honest folk at this
hour? I would have you know I have a gun here for
thieves, and——”</p>

<p>“Hark you, fellow!” I cried sternly, stepping out where
the moonlight fell full upon my face, while six pistols
covered him. “If the door be not open in two minutes I
will blow in the lock and serve you as I served the steward
yonder. Do you hear, you knave?” I continued fiercely.
“You shall hang, on my word of honour!” For here I
had no women to deal with.</p>

<p>Perhaps he read in my face that I should keep my
word—perhaps the fate that had overtaken the steward’s
obstinacy decided him.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said slowly, disappearing from the window.
Presently he opened the door.</p>

<p>“Now what do you want of me?” he said sullenly.</p>

<p>“To release the man,” I said sharply.</p>

<p>“I have not the key,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Ah!” I said slowly. “And how know you that we desired
a key, my friend? Your own words convict you.
No, no,” I continued with a sneer, as he could find no
words in answer; “you have not the key, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and the village has not the key—but you have tools here,
Master Blacksmith, and strong arms to wield them. So
get you speedily what you require, if you would not
swing at your own door.”</p>

<p>In short, a few minutes later found us back at the
stocks, and the blacksmith began his task. Nevertheless,
so stout was the iron, that it required a full twenty
minutes’ filing ere the man was released from his unpleasant
position. They carried him into the inn, and
having seen him restored to consciousness and his wound
dressed, I set about considering our position. As to
who were his actual assailants the man himself could give
no information, for he had been struck down ere he had
advanced two steps within the stable. And the horses?
’Twas worse than folly to search for them by night,
and by this time they were no doubt miles away, or hidden
in some secluded spot amongst the torrs.</p>

<p>And both the landlord and his assistants swore so
volubly that they knew nothing of the occurrence, for
that they were serving the troopers at the time, that,
strongly as I suspected them, I could prove nothing.</p>

<p>And so soundly rating the troopers for their carelessness,
I returned presently to the manor, but not to rest.
For I sat watching and listening at the open window,
with my pistols at my side and sword unsheathed, until
the first streaks of dawn were lightening the sky. Not
till then did I throw myself upon my couch and court
forgetfulness in slumber.</p>

<p>Ah, my lady, my lady! The game to be played out
between us has opened in your favour! Who will secure
the final trick?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>OF HOW MY LADY PLAYED DELILAH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Brightly</span> the sunshine streamed into my little room on
this the first of July, 1690, a day destined to become
famous in the history of Ireland, and with its dawn to
usher a new era into that misgoverned island.</p>

<p>I sprang from my couch with nerves braced for the
duties of the coming day. I was not without some misgivings
that I might find my own horse to be missing.
But upon opening the stable door, there was the sorrel
standing in the stall, apparently unharmed. And much
relieved in my own mind as regarded his safety, I led him
into the yard, and mounting, rode swiftly to the village.</p>

<p>Here I found the sergeant and his men awaiting my
arrival and eager to commence the search for the missing
animals. But I was not minded to leave the inn wholly
unguarded, and, moreover, the wounded man was still
weak from the blow he had received and the subsequent
loss of blood, and was ill fitted to take part in what
might prove an arduous undertaking. I left the
sergeant and three men, therefore, to keep him company,
all fully armed and this time alert enough against surprise,
and with the remaining eight troopers at my
heels commenced the search. The track of the horses led
from the stables to a little stream some hundred yards
away, and there abruptly ceased. As this stream came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
from the torrs, I felt convinced that it was there we
should look for them, probably hidden in some secluded
hut, or in one of the many boulder-strewn hollows that
lay amongst the hills. We turned our faces, therefore,
in that direction, scattering on both sides of the stream
and striving to pick up the lost trail.</p>

<p>But though we advanced some four miles thus, there
was no sign of any tracks having left the water, and
the farther we advanced, the wilder grew the scenery.
Hitherto we had been ascending a series of gentle slopes,
with scattered clumps of trees here and there, that grew
into a dense wood on the summit of a hill immediately
in front of us.</p>

<p>When we had descended into the valley beyond, we
found ourselves completely shut in by the torrs, with
nothing on either side of us but the desolate, treeless
slopes with their monotonous covering of withered grass.
And to add to our discomfort, the sun was gaining in
power. Yet this, indeed, gave way presently to still
wilder scenery than any we had yet met with; for what
had before been mere hollows between the hills soon
changed into deep glens, in any one of which a regiment
might safely have been hidden away without discovery.
Small wonder, then, that in diligently searching amongst
these we soon became hopelessly lost; nor for all our
endeavours could we again find the way by which we
had come. Nay, more, we had so turned and doubled in
the course of the last half hour that I was completely at
a loss as to the direction in which Cleeve now lay. For
all I knew every step that we advanced might be taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
us farther and farther away from it. And seeing this,
about noon I called a halt in a deep glen, where an overhanging
bank afforded us some protection from the sun,
though the stifling heat of the hollow was well-nigh
unbearable. And here we dined upon the scanty fare
with which each man had provided himself before leaving
the village, though in this respect my sorrel came but
poorly off, for of water there was none. As for me,
small appetite had I for food, being, indeed, a prey to
the keenest anxiety. A hundred times I blamed myself
for proceeding so far and for thus abandoning the little
party at the inn.</p>

<p>What might not have happened in our absence?
Granted they were well armed and forewarned against
surprise, nevertheless, small chance had four men against
forty, and ’twas not so much with force I feared they
had to deal as guile.</p>

<p>Yet the day was wearing on, and here were we powerless
to render them any assistance. I sprang impatiently
to my feet, and leaving the troopers to their meal, I
climbed the hillside above; for it was not improbable that
from the summit I might obtain sight of some landmark
that might give me a clue as to our whereabouts. But
again disappointment awaited me. There was nothing
to be seen but a ring of encircling hills, devoid, so far
as I could see, of human habitation. With a bitter curse
at my own stupidity I descended the hill, and again we
set out in the direction in which I imagined Cleeve lay.</p>

<p>But this, it seemed, was but to entangle us worse
amongst the hills; and for hours we wandered in a network<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
of narrow ravines, each of which exactly resembled
its fellow, and seemed but to mock us by its similarity.
Of our subsequent wanderings I prefer to say but little.
It was not, however, until sunset that, footsore and
weary, we arrived once more at the village.</p>

<p>No sooner did we come in sight of the inn than I was
reassured as to the safety of the men I had left behind
by the sight of the sergeant placidly smoking in the
open doorway. In the street beyond a few rustics were
standing at their doors, or chatted to one another across
the street; and the whole scene was as peaceful an aspect
as any village in England. Whilst the men were quenching
their thirst with copious draughts of ale, I drew the
sergeant aside and questioned him as to what had happened
in our absence. It was in doing this that, glancing
through the open window near which we were
standing, I saw one of the troopers watering my horse
in the yard. This done, he turned and led him towards
the stable. But no sooner had he flung open the door
than the empty bucket fell from his hand, and he uttered
a shout that brought us running to his side. He was
still standing, staring into the shed as if petrified.</p>

<p>“What is it? What do you see, man?” I cried as I
approached.</p>

<p>“Look,” he answered, pointing, with a white face,
within. “They are there!”</p>

<p>I flung him aside and peered eagerly into the stable.
I could not believe my eyes; for there, in the very place
which we had quitted twelve hours before on our fruitless
quest, a dozen horses were standing in the stalls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“But they are gone, man! They are gone!” I stammered
stupidly when I had recovered the use of my
tongue.</p>

<p>“Aye, they are gone,” said the sergeant laconically,
“as you see.”</p>

<p>But now as the fact of their reappearance became plain
to all, from the weary, sweating troopers there burst such
a chorus of profanity as caused the horses themselves to
turn their heads in mild surprise. As for me, I leaned
against the doorway, and the ludicrousness of the situation
striking me, gave way to unrestrained laughter—laughter,
however, which had in it more of relief than
mirth. For consider for a moment the situation. Here
was the mare’s nest of danger that I had been raising
to myself all day resolved into nothing more than a
practical jest, designed, I had no doubt, by my lady to
cause us annoyance.</p>

<p>While we had spent the day in tramping the countryside
in useless search, the horses had been snugly concealed
most likely in a cottage near at hand. The trick
was humiliating, to say the least of it. On one point,
however, it set me at rest. Surely they would not have
returned the horses had they contemplated any sinister
design against us. Nevertheless, in order to guard
against a repetition of surprise, I bade two of the
troopers sleep in the loft above the stable. And I also
resolved to seek an explanation of my lady at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p>Returning to the inn, I gave the sergeant a few further
instructions, promising, indeed, to return again at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
ten o’clock to see that all was done to ensure safety for
the night; and this in the presence of the landlord,
though the significance of this fact did not occur to me
till long afterwards.</p>

<p>This done, I ordered my horse to the door, and arming
myself ere leaving the inn with a weapon which I thought
might prove useful in the coming interview that I promised
myself, I mounted my horse and rode away.</p>

<p>Arriving at the manor, I found the same lifelessness
there that had characterised it on the preceding day, but
little I recked of this at the time, for my mind was fully
engrossed in thinking what I should say to my lady and
in speculating upon her reply. I dismounted at the
stables and gave the weary sorrel into the charge of the
youth Martin who was loitering there. As I flung him
the rein, “See that he is ready saddled for me in an
hour’s time,” I said quietly. For answer he made a wry
face and moved away with a short, derisive laugh.</p>

<p>I stood gazing after him in undisguised astonishment.
At any other time, when my mind had not been so preoccupied,
I should have chastised the young boor for his
insolence. As it was, I shrugged my shoulders contemptuously
and turned away. Bah! ’twas only natural, after
all. Like mistress, like man! I lingered for awhile upon
the terrace, loth to go indoors, until the last purple tints
faded from the western sky and the soft July night
wrapped the house and gardens in its silent embrace.
Anon, the full moon rose above Cleevesborough, silvering
the surrounding oaks and streaking the grass with their
checkered shadows. Presently with a half drawn sigh I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
rose from the terrace wall upon which I had been leaning
and passed slowly into the house. Within doors I met
with the same monastic silence, though I found the
candles lighted and my supper awaiting me in the dining
hall; and laying aside my encumbering weapons, I applied
myself to the dishes before me with all the zest of
a starving man. When my hunger was appeased I filled
my glass, and leaning back in my chair, gave myself up
to my thoughts. And who shall say into what realms of
fancy my thoughts strayed, or what dream faces of the
future I saw in the flickering flame of the candles before
me. Only I know that the dark eyes of my lady of Cleeve
looked out at me, and her proud, elusive face stared at
me from the shadows of the room. I strove to bring
my mind back to the events of the past day, and the
more convinced I became that the whole plot had originated
in her fertile mind. For what object I had yet
to learn. A glance at the clock convinced me that it was
too late to seek an interview with her that night—to-morrow
I would demand of her an explanation. And
in the possession of that which I carried in my breast,
I fancied that I should meet with some consideration at
her hands. I roused myself at length from these reflections,
and rising, took my cloak from the chair
where I had laid it, and proceeded to buckle on my
sword. This done I laid my loaded pistols upon the
table, and raising my half-emptied glass to my lips,
drained its contents preparatory to taking my departure.</p>

<p>“Captain Cassilis!” said a soft voice clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>I turned sharply at the sound. And at sight of the
radiant vision before me, I caught my breath with a
great gasp of wonder, and the glass fell unheeded to the
floor and was shattered into a dozen pieces at my feet;
for my lady herself was descending the stairs! My lady
in a gown of brocaded satin, with a bunch of red and yellow
roses in her hand. The low cut corsage that she wore
displayed to full advantage the magnificent proportions
of her bust, upon which diamonds flashed and sparkled
in the light. Upon her gleaming hair was a large hat of
pale blue velvet of the same colour as her gown and
ornamented at the front with a massive silver clasp. Beneath
this her eyes shone with a radiance that rivalled the
jewels at her breast, and if ’twas not to Nature only
that she owed the increased loveliness of her face, why
then she was so exquisitely painted, that to the eyes of a
plain soldier like myself its presence was undetectable.
For the rest, one jewelled hand slightly raised the skirt
of her trailing gown, affording a glimpse of the rich
satin petticoat beneath and of a pair of high-heeled
shoes with diamond studded buckles. And this portrait
of my lady I carry ever in my mind through all the
years; for of a truth never had she appeared so beautiful
as on that night, when all the resources of art had been
requisitioned to increase her alluring beauty and excitement
had lent an added brilliancy to her eyes.</p>

<p>“Have I your permission to enter, sir?” she said softly,
pausing upon the lowest step and gazing at me without
apparently noticing my confusion. Only then did her
words break the spell that held me tongue-tied. With a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
great effort I strove to recover my composure, though
my heart thumped painfully in my breast and I felt the
hot blood mantling to my face.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I stammered at length, “such permission in
your own house is surely unnecessary. Especially,” I
added somewhat bitterly, “as I will not intrude my unwelcome
presence upon you.” And with a bow I flung
my cloak over my arm.</p>

<p>“In that case, sir,” she answered quickly, “I fear that
the very object of my visit will be defeated.”</p>

<p>“Your ladyship means——?” I replied, pausing in
surprise.</p>

<p>“That it is to beg the favour of a few moments’ speech
with you that I am here.”</p>

<p>“With me, madam?”</p>

<p>“With you!” she answered, smiling at my too evident
astonishment, though not without some trace of embarrassment
in her manner.</p>

<p>I was silent out of sheer curiosity, for her looks, her
changed manner towards me, puzzled me.</p>

<p>“Captain Cassilis,” she said abruptly, “will you accept
these few roses at my hands—in return for those which
I so ungraciously flung away?”</p>

<p>And without waiting for my reply, she advanced with
a soft rustling of her rich gown to the table and commenced
to arrange them in a cut-glass bowl that graced
the centre of the board.</p>

<p>As for me, I know that I stammered some reply, I
scarcely remember what, for my eyes were fixed in open
admiration upon her tall, graceful figure as she bent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
above the flowers. From where I stood upon the hearth,
slightly behind her, yet close enough for the scent of her
clinging draperies to be wafted to me, I could mark the
faultless curve of her waist, the bare, white shoulders,
and beneath her velvet hat the heavy waving masses of
her hair—maddening, bewildering hair, that with every
turn of her lovely head glittered in the light with the
sheen of burnished gold.</p>

<p>My lady indeed seemed unconscious of my scrutiny as
she busied herself with her task, but I fancied there was
a half smile upon her lips when she turned to me suddenly
and said:</p>

<p>“But I have not yet acquainted you with the object of
my intrusion. I should be guilty of worse than ingratitude
if I did not thank you, sir, for the service you so
timely rendered me yesterday. If I have withheld my
thanks until now, it is not that I underrate its value, nor
forget the peril that you risked on my behalf.” And
she flashed a glance at me that again set my heart beating
rapidly.</p>

<p>“I beg that you will say no more, madam,” I cried
hastily. “Your words already far exceed any merit that
you may consider attached to my action.”</p>

<p>“I think that I am the best judge of that, sir,” she
answered, smiling.</p>

<p>“The man was insulting you, madam,” I replied
gravely. “In that I chanced to be in the wood at
the time I count myself fortunate. Yet the meanest
beggar maiden had claimed the like assistance at my
hands.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>“I thank you for the comparison, sir,” my lady answered
in a slight tone of pique.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, madam!” I replied humbly. “I fear
that I put my meaning but clumsily, and with the
language of the camp rather than of the Court. Yet,
believe me—saving always my duty to the uniform I
wear—my sword is ever at your service.”</p>

<p>“And in these troublous times a good sword
is more priceless than rubies,” she said lightly.
“Have a care, sir, that I do not take you at your
word.”</p>

<p>“I ask for no more, madam,” I replied earnestly. “Be
assured that you will not find it to fail you.”</p>

<p>To this she answered nothing in words, but again she
raised her lustrous eyes to mine. And by that glance
I accounted myself amply repaid both for the danger
I had escaped and for incurring De Brito’s enmity; for
if she had seemed beautiful before, judge how enchanting
she now appeared, when all scorn and pride had vanished
from her face and left her a very woman. Seeing
her in this softer mood, I felt my courage rapidly returning.</p>

<p>“And I also have somewhat to say to you, my lady,” I
commenced after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” she answered inquiringly. “But I fear that
I detain you, sir? You were going out?”</p>

<p>“To the village, madam,” I replied, “but that can wait.”</p>

<p>And again I laid aside my cloak.</p>

<p>“Then you will not ask me to sit down, Mr. Cassilis?”
she said archly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Madam,” I stammered in reply, crimsoning with confusion,
“forgive my lack of courtesy. If I had for a
moment thought, that——” And I hastily crossed the
floor to where a large leather-covered chair stood
against the wall. I was in the act of lifting this when,
happening to raise my eyes to an oval mirror that hung
above it on the oak-panelled wall, I caught the reflection
of my lady’s face behind me. And it was so
changed, so stamped with a look of scorn and repulsion,
that I dropped the chair I was raising and turned
hastily round. Yet there stood my lady beside the table,
gazing smilingly at me with sparkling eyes, so that I
was fain to believe that my own had deceived me, or that
the mirror by some trick had played me false. Without
more ado, therefore, I raised the chair and returned
to her side.</p>

<p>“Will you place it here for me, Captain Cassilis!” she
said, moving with a click of her high heels near to one
of the open windows. “Is not the night too lovely to miss
enjoying?”</p>

<p>Obediently I placed my burden on the spot she indicated,
and she seated herself, facing the open window.
In truth it was a most lovely night. From where she
sat a glorious vista was obtained of the broad, straight
terrace, the sloping lawns, whitened by the moon, with
the dark shadow of the woods beyond. And, rising above
these latter, in the direction of the village, the massive,
square tower of the church.</p>

<p>A momentary silence fell upon us as we gazed—a silence
which was broken at length by my lady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“And now that I am all attention, sir,” she said lightly,
“what is it that you wish to say to me?”</p>

<p>“Why, madam——” I began, and I hesitated awkwardly,
all the fine speeches I had prepared beforehand
vanishing on the instant from my memory, under the disconcerting
gaze of her dark eyes. “What of the
horses?” I ended somewhat lamely.</p>

<p>She gave a low, musical laugh, that went rippling
through the room.</p>

<p>“As to your horses, sir!” she replied, “I have not heard
that any one is missing.”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I answered with what sternness I could
muster. “True, there are none missing, but I fail to
see what object there was in their abduction.”</p>

<p>“When you had matched your cleverness against mine,
sir?” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“I confess that I had not looked upon it in that light,”
I replied. “So to your ladyship I must ascribe their
disappearance and for myself a day’s toilsome search.”</p>

<p>“I did not say so!” she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>“But you implied it, madam,” I persisted. “I am as
well assured that the plan itself emanated from your
ladyship as I am that your servants carried it into execution.”</p>

<p>“You would not have me incriminate them, sir?” she said
quickly.</p>

<p>“There is no need, my lady,” I answered grimly. “For
you forget that it requires but a word from me to
arrest them on suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Then if I were you, sir,” she replied in a low voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
“I would be generous. The lion can well afford to spare
the mouse.”</p>

<p>“True, madam,” I answered; “but when the mouse happens
to stand six feet six, with a sword in due proportion,
it behooves the lion to look well to his own safety!”</p>

<p>Again she smiled, but on a sudden her face became
grave.</p>

<p>“I would not have any one suffer for what was, perhaps,
a foolish trick,” she said. “I pray you, sir—if, indeed,
you meditate retaliation for the annoyance caused
you—let the punishment fall upon me.”</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at her without replying. The
idea of any man punishing the lovely woman before me
was well-nigh inconceivable.</p>

<p>“Reassure yourself, madam,” I said at length. “Your
servants will take no injury at my hands. Only there
must be no recurrence of such a trick. My troopers are
rough, and for one at least of their number it has proved
but a sorry jest.”</p>

<p>“Alas, poor man!” she answered.</p>

<p>“How, madam!” I cried incredulously. “You pity
him?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” she replied quickly.</p>

<p>“Well—because I do not understand you, madam,” I
burst out.</p>

<p>“I am a woman, sir,” she answered. “Is not that reason
logical enough?”</p>

<p>“Yet a few days ago nothing would have been too bad
to happen to them,” I said bluntly.</p>

<p>“A few days ago, sir, I did not know many things that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
I do now,” she rejoined, toying with a rope of pearls
that hung from her shoulders. “And in that I pity him,
I do but make use of the prerogative of my sex. ’Tis the
divine right of woman to be inconsistent.”</p>

<p>To this I found no reply, and again we fell silent.</p>

<p>Suddenly my lady leaned forwards.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cassilis,” she said winningly, “will you answer
me a question?”</p>

<p>“If it is in my power to do so, certainly, madam,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Then will you as a soldier tell me candidly what chance
of success has James in Ireland?”</p>

<p>“My lady,” I answered, after a few moments’ pause,
“you have asked me for my candid opinion, and giving
that, I dare not buoy you up with false hopes. This only
will I say, that the army which James has got together
is as inferior in arms and discipline to that of William
as the former leader’s ability as a general is surpassed
by the latter’s military genius. One issue alone is possible—the
downfall of the Stuart cause.”</p>

<p>She remained silent for a few moments, digesting, I
suppose, my words. On a sudden she looked up.</p>

<p>“You have seen much service abroad, sir?” she said inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Aye, madam,” I made answer. “My sword has been
drawn in many quarrels and has owned many masters.”</p>

<p>“But always in the cause of honour, sir,” she said
quickly.</p>

<p>“Honour?” I rejoined. “Ah, madam, what have such
as I to do with honour? Honour—a chimera—the dream<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
of fools! With me, that is the cause of honour which
puts most guineas in my purse, be the right of the
quarrel what it may.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said impulsively, “I could not live a life
like that.”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam,” I answered quietly, “but you are a
woman—a woman sweet and beautiful and pure—thank
God for it!”</p>

<p>“A woman with a woman’s wayward passions and sins,”
she replied.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lady,” I answered, “sins?—you?”</p>

<p>She stopped me with a gesture of her hand. “How
should you judge, sir, of a woman’s responsibilities or
errors?”</p>

<p>“True, madam,” I replied with a sigh, “for I have
known so few.”</p>

<p>“But have you no relatives, Mr. Cassilis?” she said
slowly. “Is there no sister or one more dear to you that
looks to you for protection?”</p>

<p>“None, my lady,” I answered sadly. “A sister, indeed
I had, but——” I stopped, overcome by old
memories.</p>

<p>“She is dead?” my lady said gently.</p>

<p>“Aye, madam,” I replied. “She was murdered! Nay,
nay, do not mistake my meaning. But—well, she was
beautiful, madam, and was much courted on that account.
Amongst the suitors for her hand was one—a favourite
of the late King Charles—a profligate—devoid as much
of all moral worth and honour as was his dissolute master.
Yet to this man, with a woman’s perversity, she gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the preference. Madam,” I continued in a low voice,
“You will readily guess the sequel. They were married,
contrary to all warning and advice. And the result,
which all had foreseen, speedily followed. Within two
months the libertine had wearied of his toy and of the
restraints of wedlock. In a year she was dead, killed as
surely by the man’s brutal neglect as if he had run his
rapier through her gentle heart.”</p>

<p>I stopped, overcome by the emotion that my words had
recalled to me, and stood staring at my lady, whose head
was slightly bent, and whose long lashes swept her cheek.</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a fleeting upward glance. “Forgive
me,” she said gently. “I did not know.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to forgive,” I answered quietly.
“Rather should I crave your pardon, my lady, for intruding
so sad a story upon you. It is one ill suited for
a lady’s ears. I know not why I have told you.” And
I turned from her and gazed out into the night
with eyes that saw not the moonlit gardens before
me, but only the sorrowful, girlish face of one
who had loved me well. I started when my lady’s
next words brought me to earth again. For the moment
I had forgotten her presence in the room.</p>

<p>“And this man, sir,” she said slowly, “what of
him?”</p>

<p>“I killed him, madam,” I answered quietly. “We met
one early dawn in Spring Gardens, and he there paid
to the brother that which he should have devoted to his
wife. ’Twas that that drove me from the country and set
me wandering over Europe these fifteen years. But I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
forget that this story can have but little interest for
you, my lady.”</p>

<p>“Why should it not?” she replied. “Life is full of such
sad stories.” She leant her head on her hand, and for
a moment or two we were silent. “I, too, am troubled to-night
for the safety of one I love,” she continued.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam?” I murmured as she paused.</p>

<p>“I allude to my brother,” she said quickly. “Mr.
Cassilis, you know well that a battle is imminent. Alas!
my brother is a true Ingram, in that he is so rash. I
tremble for his safety.”</p>

<p>“I trust for your ladyship’s sake that your fears are
groundless,” I replied, “and that you may welcome his
return in happier times.”</p>

<p>She smiled sadly by way of answer. And instantly my
mind recurred to the bill of attainder passed against him.
If, thought I, he is possessed of the same indomitable will
as his sister ’twill be long ere he makes his peace with
William. But I did not give expression to my thought.</p>

<p>“And yet,” she said slowly, “I know not but that it is
for the best that he is absent. Were he to know,” she
continued, with a swift, upward glance at me, “that we
were—shall I say—prisoners in our own house, I know
not of what extreme folly he might be guilty.”</p>

<p>“And who could wonder, madam?” I answered, “or
who could find it in their heart to blame him? What
danger is there which a man beloved by you would not
freely dare, and count the peril his highest privilege!
What self-sacrifice for your sake too severe for one
who loved you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Loved me?” she said, shrinking.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; who loved you!”</p>

<p>In my earnestness I had drawn near and laid one hand
upon the back of her chair. She made no reply to my
words, but I saw a slight shiver pass through her frame.</p>

<p>“Ah, madam, forgive me,” I said hastily. “The window
is open, and you are cold.” And I made as though
to close it.</p>

<p>“No, no, sir,” she cried hastily, rising to her feet in
sudden agitation. “Indeed you are mistaken. On the
contrary,” she added, raising her hand to her brow, “the
room is very close, or I am not feeling quite myself. And
I have left my fan in the garden. Will you permit me
to fetch it, Mr. Cassilis?”</p>

<p>“Nay, madam, will you not rather permit me to perform
this slight service for you, the while you remain
quietly here?”</p>

<p>“I think that it is upon the fountain in the Rose Garden,”
she murmured. Then as with a bow I turned
away, she added: “But I cannot so far trouble you, sir.
I am overmuch in your debt already.”</p>

<p>I had reached the window, but I turned at her words.</p>

<p>“A debt which you are repaying me in full to-night,
madam,” I said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Ah!” she cried, gazing at me with increased perturbation.</p>

<p>“Why do you say that, Mr. Cassilis? Why do you
speak like that?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I answered, returning her glance firmly,
“by your kindness and trust in me to-night you more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
than reward me for that which I have suffered at your
hands. And I—I seek but to serve your ladyship, however
humbly!” And I turned upon my heel and left her
standing there.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>OF HOW MY LADY PLAYED DELILAH—CONTINUED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I crossed the broad terrace, looking neither to the
right nor left, the moon flung my dark shadow upon the
gravel path and the soft night wind stole through the
silent gardens and fanned my face. But my eyes were
blind to the beauties of the silvery landscape, light as day
itself, and of the starry heavens above me; for it was
my lady! my lady! ever my lady! that was my one recurring
thought—the sum total of my reflections.</p>

<p>For the time being I was as one distraught, bewitched,
indeed, by the spell her beauty had cast upon me. Wild,
fleeting visions of the future rose before my eyes. With
the fall of the Stuart the old order had changed; who
knew what might occur under the new? A good sword
coupled with brains might carry a man far upon the road
to success in these unsettled times. He who was poor
to-day might yet aspire to climb the ladder which led
to fame, providing that he was prepared to grasp the
means of rising or had wit enough to rightly use his
opportunities. Many a man, indeed, dated the foundation
of his fortunes to the Revolution, and received a
title in reward for his services. Then why not I? The
former requisite for success I knew that I already had.
I believed that I possessed the brains, or the experience
of years of wandering had been in vain. And afterwards——?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
I had no settled purpose in my brain; all
was a chaos, through which my lady’s face alone shone,
beckoning me upward.</p>

<p>That William would be successful in the coming
struggle I had not the slightest doubt. I knew the man
well, for I had fought under him in Flanders; and
though, in the light of future history, he may not be
considered as a great soldier in the same sense as were
his contemporaries, Turenne and Luxembourg, yet he
possessed a genius for snatching victory out of defeat.
As for James, with the infatuated imbecility that characterised
him throughout every great crisis of his career,
he had taken no pains to keep up the discipline of his
troops during the past winter, wasting his time with his
so-called Court at Dublin whilst his army spread over
the surrounding country, committing every species of
rapine and plunder. One thing above all was plain to
me: Ireland at the present time was the field that offered
scope for a man’s ambition. There, when blows would
shortly be exchanged notice was to be won and
promotion achieved. Little did I guess that the battle
of the Boyne had already been lost and won, and
that even now the mean-spirited James was in full
flight for France, after reproaching his army with
the cowardice which his own folly had principally
engendered.</p>

<p>’Twas in meditating thus that I came at length to the
entrance of the rose garden and halted beneath the arch
of yew. Before me the fountain gleamed white in the
moonlight that flooded all the open space surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
and flung fantastic shadows of the closely-cropped trees
upon the grass. In the distance came faintly to my ears
the murmur of the sea, and the gardens around me were
full of the voices of the night.</p>

<p>I crossed quickly to the fountain, and even before I
reached it I saw the object of my errand lying upon the
marble basin. It was in all respects a dainty fan—a
thing of painted silk and ivory, with the perfume of
violets yet clinging to it, and with my lady’s monogram
in gold upon the handle. I lingered for a few moments,
holding it in my hand, recalling again the face of its
beautiful owner, and pondering upon our late conversation.</p>

<p>Then with a settled purpose in my mind, I retraced my
steps by way of the terraces, and so to the house. I
found my lady seated in the same room where I had
left her. She looked up quickly when I entered and
thanked me prettily in a few low-spoken words. The
colour had deepened in her cheeks, and I noticed that the
hand which she held out for her fan was slightly trembling.
But I would have none of her thanks.</p>

<p>“Do not thank me, madam, for so slight a service,” I
said quickly. “I would do far more to pleasure your
ladyship, a proof of which I am about to give you.” I
drew from my breast the folded paper, which I had
placed there before leaving the inn. “This paper,” I
began slowly, gazing straight at my lady, who had risen
in sudden agitation, “of which I took possession in this
very hall, under certain circumstances that I doubt not
are still fresh in your ladyship’s memory, and that bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
a dangerous resemblance to conspiracy, is folded as you
see it was folded when it came into my hands.”</p>

<p>She did not seem to comprehend the full significance of
my words or to grasp my meaning. I paused for a
moment, and continued more slowly: “Am I wrong in
supposing this paper to contain the names of a few
gallant but misguided gentlemen who favour the cause
of James?”</p>

<p>“You should best know, sir,” she replied in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No, my lady,” I answered quietly; “that is where you
are wrong. I do not know the contents of this paper,
because I have not opened it.”</p>

<p>Still she gazed at me as if she did not understand. On
a sudden she drew a step nearer, and I saw the colour
fade from her face. Doubtless until this moment she
had thought that I had already made use of it—had
placed it in the hands of the authorities.</p>

<p>“You—you have not opened it?” she said in a troubled
voice.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I answered. “Scarcely can I expect you
to believe me, yet on my honour as a gentleman it is the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Then—then—you mean——” she faltered, resting
both hands upon the table and leaning forward, probing
my eyes as if she would read my soul.</p>

<p>I met her gaze unflinchingly.</p>

<p>“The names that this paper contains are known to you,
madam?” I replied quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered; and I saw that she was trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Then, my lady,” I answered firmly, stepping to the
table and holding the paper in the flame of the nearest
candle until only a little feathery ash remained, “I give
the lives of these gentlemen to you. Your secret is your
own.”</p>

<p>“You give them to me, sir?” she cried passionately.
“You do this for me? Ah, Mr. Cassilis, why do you
shame me so?”</p>

<p>“How, madam?” I said, totally at a loss to understand
her words. “Shame you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes—shame me,” she continued in the same
passionate tone, “by this that you have done for me;
by the forbearance that you have shown towards me—towards
one who is unworthy——”</p>

<p>“My lady,” I cried, “unworthy?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she continued, “if you would not believe in me;
if you knew all—if you knew!” She broke off and
laughed a trifle wildly. “Ah, forget my foolish words!”</p>

<p>“Say, rather, that it will be my happiness to remember
them, madam,” I replied gravely; though I confess that
I was puzzled at her marked agitation, for which, so far
as I could see, there was no adequate reason. “And do
not think that I blame you for your devotion to the
cause of James. Were there many among his adherents
as courageous as yourself, we should speedily see the
Stuart back at Whitehall. Though in the accomplishment
of this object you have not my sympathy, yet the
very boldness of the scheme by which you hoped to effect
a rising in this county cannot but command my admiration.
The very hopelessness of imagining that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
could succeed in the face of William’s settled government
would appeal to any soldier.”</p>

<p>“And you who wear his uniform—you to whom these
men were enemies—can yet find it in your heart to spare
them?” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>I took two steps towards her.</p>

<p>“Nay, do not credit me with a generosity which a
nature such as mine is incapable of forming. A month
ago I would have sent these men to death and recked
little of the doing, save, indeed, to count it to my credit.
Shall I tell your ladyship why I have not done so?”</p>

<p>She made a faint gesture of protest, but I took no heed
and continued: “Because I knew that your name headed
the list, madam.” And I stopped, overcome by my own
temerity.</p>

<p>She had moved to the window while I was speaking,
and her face was turned from me. I could not guess
what thoughts were passing through her brain, but I
fancied that I saw her shoulders heave. Yet she made
no reply, though I waited almost trembling for the
words that did not come.</p>

<p>“I can feel but little sympathy for men who required
a woman’s name to stimulate them to action,” I said
at length. “On your part it was a brave deed to do,
though a foolish one. Yet had I been in your place,
doubtless I, too, should have considered that the end
justified the means.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” she cried, turning swiftly to face me, “say those
words again! Do you think that, Mr. Cassilis? Do
you indeed believe that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>“What, madam?” I answered, smiling.</p>

<p>“That—that the end justifies the means?” she said
almost fiercely. “Surely that is true, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Providing always that the means employed be honourable,
madam,” I replied.</p>

<p>“And if not?” she cried quickly. “What if—if I—had
given my word—had pledged myself to a certain
course—then——”</p>

<p>“I think that the thing is too monstrous for supposition,”
I replied firmly. “That aught dishonourable and
you could have anything in common is beyond conception.”</p>

<p>Again she turned away to the window, and stood looking
over the park. In the silence that followed it was
not without a certain guilty surprise that I heard the
church clock strike ten. Suddenly I remembered my
promise to the sergeant.</p>

<p>“I regret that I must take leave of you, madam,” I
said hastily. “I was unaware that the hour had grown so
late.”</p>

<p>“You must leave me so soon, Mr. Cassilis?” she said,
with a reproachful glance. “I was hoping that you
would tell me somewhat of your life abroad.”</p>

<p>“And believe me sincere when I say that it is not from
any choice of mine that I cannot stay to gratify your
curiosity, madam,” I replied. “To-morrow, should you
be of the same mind, I shall count myself fortunate in
relating the experiences of a life that has been mostly
spent in roving the cities of the Continent. To-night
it is impossible, for a soldier’s first obedience is to duty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>“Do not let me detain you, sir,” she answered somewhat
coldly, turning slowly from the window and moving
towards the stair.</p>

<p>“I trust, madam,” I said humbly, anxious not to lose
her good opinion, “that you are not offended by my
abrupt departure?”</p>

<p>“How should that be, Mr. Cassilis?” she replied
graciously. “Are we not friends?”</p>

<p>I bowed low to conceal the exultation her words caused
me, and then, taking my hat and cloak, I advanced to
the table for my pistols. On a sudden I was startled
by a low cry of pain from behind me. I turned swiftly
at the sound. My lady had stumbled upon the lowest
step and had fallen forward upon her hands. She recovered
her feet almost immediately, but only to lean
with half-closed eyes against the carved oak balustrade.</p>

<p>“Are you ill, madam?” I cried anxiously, crossing
quickly to her side.</p>

<p>“No, no, it is nothing, sir,” she gasped. “Only my
foot slipped, and my wrist—I am afraid that it is
sprained.” And again a piteous little moan that was
almost a sob escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“Let me summon assistance, madam,” I said hastily,
stepping to the door.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried again, “I beg that you will not,
sir. Indeed, it is nothing, and I would not alarm my—my
sister.”</p>

<p>“Yet I fear that you are in pain, my lady,” I said,
pausing irresolutely, my hand upon the handle.</p>

<p>“It will pass, sir,” she answered bravely. “It is foolish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
of me, and you will think me a great coward, Mr. Cassilis,
but I would not cause unnecessary alarm; and if—if
I may rest here for a moment, until this faintness is
passed——”</p>

<p>As she spoke she moved somewhat unsteadily across the
floor and sank again into the chair with a long-drawn,
shuddering sigh she strove in vain to suppress.</p>

<p>I stood gazing at her, torn by conflicting emotions. It
was growing late and I had already broken my word
to the sergeant; yet, almost as if she divined my
thoughts, she raised her head.</p>

<p>“Are you still there, sir?” she said in a low voice, with
a quiver as of pain in it. “Ah, let me beg of you to
leave me!” And she leaned her head upon her hand so
that I could no longer see her face—to hide her tears,
I fancied.</p>

<p>I flung my cloak and hat from me and returned slowly
to her side. She was a woman and in pain. I could do
no less.</p>

<p>“Since that you do not desire me to call your women,
madam,” I said hesitatingly, “if you would permit me
to look at your wrist myself. I am possessed of some
slight knowledge of surgery,” I continued, growing
bolder at her silence—“a knowledge acquired by many
years’ familiarity with wounds and sickness in foreign
lands.”</p>

<p>She did not make any reply to this, nor even a gesture
of dissent. I waited for a few moments in silence.</p>

<p>“May I, madam?” I said at length, in a voice I strove
to render steady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>“If you would be so good, sir,” she murmured.</p>

<p>With my heart beating furiously, I sank upon one
knee beside her and gently took her white hand in both
my own strong brown ones. Gently as I raised it, however,
at my touch I saw a tremor of pain pass through
her.</p>

<p>It was with momentary surprise that as she turned her
face swiftly towards me I noted there were no traces
of tears upon her cheeks, but that her eyes were hard
and glittering. Yet I was in no condition to remark
upon this at the time, for the warm touch of her hand
rendered me scarcely less agitated than she was for some
reason herself. As I gazed at the soft, white wrist and
jewelled fingers resting quietly in mine, in the silence
of the room I could hear the loud beating of my own
heart, and I know that my hands were trembling.</p>

<p>For now that I was in such near proximity to her, I fell
beneath the spell of her wondrous beauty, as many a
better man, I ween, had done before me. So close, indeed,
was I, that a fold of her rich gown swept my knee—so
close that I could mark every heave of her white bosom
as it rose and fell stormily; and the perfume of her
presence was in my nostrils.</p>

<p>In that moment, with the lovely, flower-like face in its
frame of gold so close to mine, I forgot my promise to
the sergeant—the lateness of the hour—the difference of
rank—my duty—all!</p>

<p>Kneeling there at her feet, I would have given up honour,
life—nay, my very hope of heaven itself, to do her
pleasure. Madness, you will say. Aye, such madness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
as moved the first unhappy parent of our race—madness
which women will inspire till time shall be no more.</p>

<p>Something of what was passing in my mind must have
appeared in my face, for my lady shrank back a little
and made as if to withdraw her hand; and at that I bent
my head to hide my tell-tale eyes and made a brief examination
of her wrist. There was no sign of bruise upon
the white, rounded arm—such an arm as Venus herself
might have envied, where the blue veins meandered beneath
a skin as soft as velvet.</p>

<p>“I do not think that the injury sustained is serious,
madam,” I said after a few moments. “Nevertheless, it
were well to avoid using your hand as much as possible
until it has been seen by your own physician.”</p>

<p>As I was speaking, I took the silken scarf that I wore
at my throat and deftly bound it round her wrist, in
the manner that I had watched a little French surgeon
do the like for me, when an unlucky fall from my horse
had once kept my sword within its sheath for well-nigh
a month.</p>

<p>“There, madam,” I said in a low voice, tying the ends
of the scarf into a bow, “I think that for the present, at
least, that bandage will serve, for fault of a better one.”
And, moved by a sudden uncontrollable impulse, I raised
her hand to my lips.</p>

<p>Again a quick shudder passed through her, and with
a low, startled cry she snatched away her hand almost
roughly and rose quickly to her feet.</p>

<p>And I rose, too, and our eyes met.</p>

<p>“Ah, forgive me, madam!” I said humbly. “I fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
that my roughness has hurt you. Yet God knows how
willingly I would bear your pain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” she cried passionately, “I am in pain, but
not as you think, sir. It is your solicitude for me, your
generous care for me, that hurts me—that brands me
to-night with shame. And yet—and yet—” she muttered,
passing her hand across her brow, “you have said
that the end justifies the means. They were your own
words, sir.”</p>

<p>“With a qualification, madam,” I said quietly.</p>

<p>She raised her hand with a gesture of entreaty.</p>

<p>“Spare me!” she cried, with increased agitation. “Do
not add by your words to the sense of infamy I feel.
Perhaps even yet it is not too late—perhaps—ah!——”
She broke off with a sudden gasp and I saw the colour
had forsaken her face.</p>

<p>Thinking nothing but that the faintness had returned
to her, I took a step hurriedly towards her. But in a
moment I realised that she was not looking at me, but
that her gaze was rivetted upon something behind my
back.</p>

<p>I turned swiftly to glance at the open window. And
there a sight met my eyes that caused me to pause in
genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>I have already said that above the trees of the park
rose the square Norman tower of the church; and now
upon the summit of the tower a bright light suddenly
flashed, that grew momentarily in volume, until a broad
sheet of flame ascended into the sky. Some one had
kindled a fire upon the church tower—for what? One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
object, and one alone, was possible. It was a signal.
And even as I gazed, upon the still night air came the
sound of two shots fired in quick succession—aye, and
following hard upon them a dozen straggling reports—and
then silence. But with those reports the instincts
of the soldier returned to me. There was danger, then—danger
at the village—and I was not there to share!</p>

<p>I stood for a moment summing up all the possibilities
of the situation; and in that moment a dozen or more
lanterns broke from the woodland path that led to the
village, and a little crowd of dark figures, with here and
there the moonlight giving back the flash of steel, made
straight for the terrace. At that my brain cleared with
lightning rapidity, and turning swiftly, I snatched my
pistols from the table.</p>

<p>Was it force of habit merely, or some dim suspicion
of the truth that caused me to bend closer to look at
them in the light of the candles?</p>

<p>A single glance was sufficient. The flints had been removed—the
weapons were useless! I stood staring at
them in dull perplexity; and then I raised my eyes and
they fell upon my lady.</p>

<p>She was standing upon the hearth, erect and motionless,
both hands pressed against her bosom, gazing at me with
a strange expression, half fearful, half defiant, as if
some secret struggle were raging in her breast. She
did not speak; there was no need for words. In her
face, her attitude, I received the full confirmation of my
suspicions—read the truth in all its naked hideousness.</p>

<p>Now I remembered all too late that I had left my spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
flints in my holsters. Now I understood only too well
for what purpose my lady had left her fan in the garden,
who it was that had tampered with the weapons in
my hands. With a sickening feeling of despair I realised
that all this time she had been but playing a part, had
been the lure to keep me from the village while they
worked their will upon the men whom I commanded.
Her graciousness, her altered demeanour towards me,
had been but assumed—part of the snare into which,
despite my boasted knowledge of the world, I had fallen
as easily as any rustic Corydon.</p>

<p>On a sudden, still with her eyes on mine, my lady slowly
raised her injured arm. Slowly, slowly, she raised it,
then with a quick, passionate gesture she tore the bandage
from her wrist and flung it into the empty grate
behind her. That broke the spell.</p>

<p>With a long-drawn, shivering breath I recovered my
composure. “God forgive you, madam,” I said quietly;
“for I believe that you have sent me to my death.” And
without further word or glance at her, I threw my useless
pistols upon the floor at her feet, and, drawing my
sword, stepped through the open window. But as I set
foot upon the terrace I realised to the full my danger;
for upon turning to the left, intending, if possible, to
reach the stables, I saw the steward and the youth Martin
advancing from their direction, and the moonlight shone
upon the barrels of the muskets in their hands. They
raised a shout at my sudden appearance, but they dared
not fire, for I was between them and their friends advancing
from the opposite end of the terrace, who now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
indeed, were within a hundred feet of me. And before
me was the moat, which even if I could by any means
clear (and my heavy riding boots rendered the chance
more than doubtful), to cross the open lawns exposed to
their shot was but to court certain death.</p>

<p>Moreover, small desire of escape was there in my heart;
for so stung was I by the knowledge of my lady’s treachery
and of my own disgrace, that I was minded to die
rather, and so to hide my shame. How after this could I
face my comrades, with the knowledge that I had betrayed
the trust reposed in me, and, despite my age and
experience, had been tricked, cozened, cheated by a
woman, like the veriest country clown.</p>

<p>A little to my right two buttresses projecting from the
wall offered security from all save a frontal attack. Between
these I ensconced myself and awaited my enemies
with the desperate determination of selling my life as
dearly as possible. In a moment they were around me—a
score or more of the hardier rogues from the village,
armed for the most part with pitchforks and scythe
blades lashed to poles, and led by Sir Rupert Courtenay,
my lady’s cousin.</p>

<p>Seeing me standing there, stern and motionless, they
came to a sudden halt, and the shouts with which they
had before greeted my appearance died away to silence.</p>

<p>“Give up your sword, sir,” said the young baronet
sharply. “Your troopers are in our hands and resistance
is futile.”</p>

<p>At that I put aside the thrust of a scythe blade from
the man who was nearest to me, at the same time slashing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
him across the wrist, and as the knaves drew back a
little, not relishing their reception, I condescended to
give him an answer.</p>

<p>“On guard, sir,” I said through my set teeth. “Unless,
indeed, you prefer to stand by and let your followers
murder me. Undoubtedly it is your safest course.”</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, thinking, I make no doubt,
of the fair girl who awaited him within the house, or perhaps
he knew my reputation with the sword, that had
made older men pause ere provoking me; but the sneering
laugh with which I accompanied my last words
caused him to flush with shame, as I had so intended.</p>

<p>“By heaven, no!” he burst out. “If you are bent on
being killed, captain, I will oblige you. And you others,
stand back. I have already an account to settle with
this gentleman.”</p>

<p>And as, obedient to his command, they drew back a little
on either side, leaving us a clearer space to wield our
weapons, he sprang impetuously forward, and our blades
clashed together. Yet scarcely had we exchanged a
dozen passes ere my lady’s voice rang high above the
music of our swords.</p>

<p>“Do not kill him! do not kill him!” she cried.</p>

<p>Whether it was that her sudden appearance within the
circle, or that the events of the night had unstrung my
nerves and robbed my hand of its cunning, I do not
know. But on a sudden my sword wavered, and in that
brief instant my opponent’s blade slipped within my
guard and his point pierced my left breast. Yet still
for a moment I did not fall. I staggered, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
against the wall, but my brain was so clear that the
whole scene was printed indelibly upon my memory.
The moonlight falling upon the ring of encircling faces,
the young baronet staring stupidly at his encrimsoned
blade, scarce crediting his victory, and, lastly, my lady’s
white, stricken face, as, wide-eyed, she gazed at the fast
reddening circle on my breast.</p>

<p>Suddenly the silence was broken by the sharp click of
her fan as it fell upon the gravel walk.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said huskily, taking two steps toward her,
with earth and sky rocking in one red mist before my
eyes, “you have dropped your fan; permit me to restore
it to you.” And I fell heavily at her feet.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>OF WHAT BEFELL ON THE TERRACE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was dark when my senses deserted me; it was still dark
when they returned amidst the accompanying roar of
the battlefield. I was stretched at full length upon the
ground, pressed down by some heavy weight that rendered
me powerless of moving hand or foot. Dimly
through the black pall of smoke that enveloped me I
thought that I recognised the outline of my old charger
Gustavus, who had borne me in safety through the perils
of many a stricken field, to meet his death at last amidst
the rout of Teneffe. So it was Teneffe then! And yonder,
where the fire flashed redly, that was the village itself,
fired by the Dutch in that last charge in which a
spent cannon-ball had struck me down. Aye, I could
see them now—a dense mass of men, fighting, struggling,
swaying to and fro amidst the blazing ruins of the hamlet.
More, I could see Conde’s veterans—victors of
Naerden, Rhimberg and the Rhine, recoiling before
the berghers and traders of the Netherlands. Nearer to
me, upon an eminence some five hundred paces distant, a
battery of French artillery added their iron tongues to
the increasing roar of the field. Faintly, whenever the
smoke drifted, I could see the gunners working madly
at their pieces; but as the retreat of their comrades before
William’s stolid infantry developed rapidly into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
rout, the guns ceased firing one by one, and limbering
up, they advanced at a gallop upon the spot where—totally
incapable of movement—I lay full in their path.</p>

<p>I struggled vainly to rise—a mountain seemed to press
me down. I strove to cry out, but no sound came from
my parched lips. Nearer and nearer, swifter and
swifter, they swept down upon me, in one fierce tempest
of maddened horses and shouting men, with the great
guns swaying behind them. Now, so close were they,
that I could see the wild, straining eyes of the horses and
the blackened faces of the gunners, who lashed their
teams to frenzy. Now with a trembling of the ground
beneath me—a nightmare of blood-red beasts and giant
riders—they were upon me, over me. With a despairing
cry I flung out my arm and awoke to a full consciousness
of my surroundings.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath and lay for a time gazing up at
the ceiling overhead, until the noises in my head gradually
subsided, and I became conscious of a fierce throbbing
in my left shoulder, that most effectually brought
back the events of the previous day to my memory.
Glancing downwards, I saw that my arm was supported
in a sling upon my breast. At that I rose with an effort
upon my right elbow and, despite the feeling of faintness
that oppressed me, took a rapid survey of my
surroundings. Clad only in my shirt and breeches, I
lay upon a bed of rugs in a room that I had never previously
seen. In what part of the manor it was situated
I could not form a guess, but from its appearance I
judged that it was used for little else than a lumber room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
Beside my couch my eyes lighted upon a tray, whereon
was set a flask of spirits, put ready there, I opined,
’gainst my awaking. I reached for the flask and drank
deeply of its contents. It was cognac—in quality the
best—and with the generous spirit I felt my strength
return to me and the life blood course swifter through
my veins. Presently I staggered to my feet and moved
somewhat unsteadily in the direction of the window. It
was guarded by three massive iron bars let into the solid
masonry, and of such a thickness as to effectually preclude
all possibility of escape in that direction. My
prison was in the left wing of the house, for below me
was the stable yard, with the stables themselves directly
facing me. No one was about, so that taking this fact,
together with the coolness of the morning air into consideration,
I judged that the hour was yet early. Ah,
but it was good to breathe the fresh sea breeze into one’s
lungs, to watch the sunlight dancing in the courtyard,
and the white, fleecy clouds chasing each other overhead.</p>

<p>I next turned my attention to the wound upon my
shoulder, striving in so far as I was able to ascertain
the exact extent of injury inflicted. To my surprise and
gratification, upon slipping my arm from the sling
which supported it, I found that I could move it with
tolerable freedom, and with no very great addition to the
pain that I already endured.</p>

<p>Presently I made the discovery that the sling itself
belonged to me—was, in fact, no other than the very
scarf which I had bound around my lady’s wrist. Up till
that moment I had been so absorbed in examining my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
prison, that I had lost all recollection of the means which
had deprived me for the time being of my liberty. But
now at the sight of this scarf, bringing back in a flood
of memory all my lady’s treachery and my own humiliation,
I fell into so fierce a rage as surely never woman
roused in man before.</p>

<p>In a sudden access of unreasoning passion I tore the
silken sling from around my neck and ground it savagely
beneath my heel. Oh, for one hour of liberty! One
hour of revenge upon this woman who had beguiled me
to my undoing! One hour to break that haughty
spirit—to bend, to crush, to bring her grovelling upon
her knees for pity! Pity? If that the time should ever
come that I could repay her for the present shame I felt
by striking her through those she loved, then let her not
look for any pity at the hands of the man whom she had
wronged, for by all I held most sacred I would not spare
her!</p>

<p>After awhile, oppressed by a feeling that I could not
breathe, I moved again to the window, that the cool sea
breeze might play upon my burning forehead.</p>

<p>“Good-day to you, general,” said a mocking voice.
“Will your lordship be pleased to require your horse this
morning?” I glanced swiftly down.</p>

<p>Below me in the courtyard was the youth Martin, and
behind him the grinning faces of the other two stable
hands. All three carried old-fashioned muskets in their
hands, with more or less rusty swords strapped to their
waists. Evidently my prison was well guarded.</p>

<p>I stepped hastily back from the casement, yet not so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
quickly but that I caught the jeering laugh with which
the words were accompanied. It was this laugh more
than the insolence of the words themselves that stung
me once more to sudden rage; and I fell to pacing the
floor in a frenzy of impotent passion.</p>

<p>Doubtless my lady had taken a pleasure in relating
to all within the house the manner in which the poor dupe
had fallen into her snare—aye, and had laughed—laughed
with them over my discomfiture! The latter
thought was maddening.</p>

<p>I stopped in my walk, and in order to seek any distraction
rather than to dwell further upon my shame,
I set to work in feverish haste to examine the lumber that
the room contained, in the hope that I might discover
some weapon with which to arm myself. Though to
what purpose, seeing that I had no strength to use it,
even if I had stumbled upon that which I sought, I did
not stop to reason. But there was no weapon of any
description to be found. Books there were in plenty,
old tapestry and pictures, china and odd-looking furniture,
in shape such as I had never previously seen, and all
bearing the same mark of extreme age.</p>

<p>Presently I desisted from my search and again peered
cautiously out of the window. The two louts still lingered
in the doorway of the stable opposite, but the
youth Martin had disappeared. Even as I stood watching
the men before me somewhere within the house a door
banged too loudly, and there came the sound of footsteps
nearing the room in which I was confined. At that I
reseated myself upon the chest and strove to regain my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
ordinary composure, for I was determined that my
gaolers should not be witnesses of how deeply I felt the
shame of my present position. The footsteps ceased in
the passage without, a key was thrust into the lock, and
a moment later the heavy door swung open, disclosing
the figure of the steward.</p>

<p>“You are to follow me,” he growled, with a sour smile.</p>

<p>“Whither?” I asked curtly.</p>

<p>“That you will soon know,” he replied, with all his old
hatred of me looking out of his eyes. “Come—no more
words.”</p>

<p>“I will know now, or I do not stir from this room,” I
said stubbornly. “Hark you, Master Steward, I have
asked you a civil question and I await your answer.”</p>

<p>“What if I refuse?” he growled. “I have it in my
power to compel you.”</p>

<p>“You may use force if it so please you,” I answered
boldly, snatching up the stool upon which I had been
sitting.</p>

<p>“But in that case I warn you there will be more than
one head broken ere I am removed.”</p>

<p>For a few moments we faced each other in silence, and
he half turned, as though he was about to summon assistance,
but apparently he thought better of it, or my
resolute attitude daunted him, for again he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Very well, if you must know,” he said with a grim
smile, “to my lady, then.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” was all I answered, though I felt my heart
quicken.</p>

<p>“And now I hope you are satisfied,” he continued, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
former insolent manner returning. “So come, let us
have no further waste of time.”</p>

<p>“What, as I am?” I cried quickly, remembering on a
sudden the scantiness of my attire. Even the shirt I
wore had been partly cut away to enable them to dress
my wound. “Where is my uniform, you rascal?”</p>

<p>“Burnt!” he answered sneeringly. “And I have no
orders to play the part of tailor.”</p>

<p>“To the devil with your orders!” I cried in a rage.
“Get me some clothes, fool! Would you have me appear
before ladies in this guise?”</p>

<p>Still for a moment he hesitated, then, “Wait,” he said
briefly. And he went out, locking the heavy door behind
him. When the last sound of his footsteps had died
away, I commenced to pace the floor in some agitation.
So I was to see my lady then? In good sooth I had need
of all my composure to face the coming interview. Not
for the world would I have her see that any words of
hers had power to move me. Not for the world would I
give her cause to triumph at my humiliation. Rapidly
I shaped out in my own mind a course of conduct to
pursue and had reduced my face to a state of impassiveness
ere, after the lapse of some ten minutes, the
steward’s returning footsteps again became audible.</p>

<p>This time he carried a bundle in his hand, which he
flung as carelessly at my feet as one might fling a bone
to some stray cur.</p>

<p>I turned it over with my foot. It was a coat of coarse
brown cloth such as any groom might wear, and reeked
indeed most vilely of the stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“Pah!” I said in disgust. “Is this the best you can find
me, man?”</p>

<p>“Best?” he cried impatiently. “Aye, and too good at
that, since it comes from the back of an honest man.
But make your choice and quickly! Either you come
of your own accord or we will drag you there. Time
presses. Which is it to be?”</p>

<p>I saw that the knave would keep his word, and now that
I knew my destination I was in no mind to appear before
my lady in so undignified a fashion. I bade him sharply
then to hold his peace and to assist me in donning the
coat—of which a closer inspection lent but an increase
to the repugnance I felt in wearing. This, indeed, seeing
that it was impossible owing to my wound that I
could accomplish of myself, he presently did, though
with much muttering the while, of which I took no
heed.</p>

<p>Even then I was forced to again resume my sling and
to fasten the one empty sleeve upon my breast, for I
found that I could not yet force my arm within it, owing
to the latter’s stiffness. This done, I turned to the
steward.</p>

<p>“I am ready,” I said curtly. “Lead on, my friend.”</p>

<p>He looked at me with a cunning smile. “Not so fast,”
he answered, stepping quickly into the passage and
drawing a pistol from his breast. “You will go first,
if you please; and play me no tricks, for I am armed,
as you see, and I have a good memory.”</p>

<p>In truth, I saw that the knave would only be too glad to
revenge himself upon me, so I shrugged my shoulders indifferently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
and turned along the passage in the direction
he indicated.</p>

<p>In this order we proceeded, then, until we reached the
entrance hall. Yet still the lout behind me pointed forward,
and we passed out of the main door, and so into
the open air.</p>

<p>But it was only when I was descending the steps that I
fully realised the scene, and the meaning of the shouts
that I had heard became plain to me. For on my right,
at the end of the terrace, where three broad steps led
down on to the grassland bordering the main avenue,
was a little group of some half dozen persons, among
whom my eyes lighted almost immediately upon the tall
figure of my lady.</p>

<p>Below them, upon the grass, the whole of the villagers,
men, women and children, seemed to have gathered; and
a clamour of derisive shouts greeted my appearance.</p>

<p>Beyond bestowing one look of contempt upon them I
took no heed, but calling all my fortitude to my aid,
with head erect and with a firm step I passed along the
terrace to where my lady awaited me.</p>

<p>As I approached nearer I scanned the persons before
me more closely. With some at least I was already acquainted.
There was Mistress Grace, who eyed me, I
thought, with a glance that bespoke more of pity for my
forlorn condition than of triumph at the successful issue
of their enterprise. Near to her was my late adversary,
the young Sir Rupert Courtenay, and three or four of
the neighbouring gentry, all of whom I knew to be of
the Jacobite persuasion; while at the head of the steps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
with a grim smile upon his face, stood the stalwart figure
of Sampson Dare. But it was with more curiosity that
I gazed upon the two men with whom my lady herself
was conversing. They were seated at a small table, a
bottle and glasses before them, and a more villainous pair
of rogues it has seldom been my lot to set eyes upon.
He who seemed to be the spokesman was dressed in a
voluminous skirted coat of blue, adorned here and there
with tarnished bold braid. Beneath this was a faded
silken vest, and I caught a glimpse of a brace of pistols
garnishing the broad belt at his waist. His legs, like
those of his companion, were encased in high sea-boots
that reached all but to his thigh, and upon his head was
an old-fashioned three-cornered hat. In years he might
have been anything from forty to sixty, but his brown
mahogany face was so scarred and wrinkled that it gave
no clear indication as to his age. That he was a seaman
I saw at a glance, and my mind instantly reverted to the
vessel I had seen in the bay. His companion was a tall,
gaunt man, dressed in a coarse blue jerkin and with a red
cotton cap upon his head. For the rest, both these
worthies wore heavy gold earrings and carried long
swords at their sides. Master and mate I took them to
be, and as it subsequently proved, my surmise was
correct.</p>

<p>At length I came to a halt, I caught the words which
he of the blue coat was addressing to my lady. “No,
no,” he was saying in a harsh voice that was well in
keeping with his whole appearance, “have no fear on
that score, mistress. They shall be treated like gentlemen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Curse me! like gentlemen. No more humane
a man than I am ever set sail from Bristol port, as Silas
Ball here will tell you.”</p>

<p>Here he looked across at the mate, who grinned
broadly, as at some excellent jest—a jest which at the
time I failed to comprehend, though afterwards I came
to experience more of the former gentleman’s humanity.</p>

<p>“Given a fair wind, in two days’ time they will be——
Is this the man?” he added abruptly, setting down his
half-emptied glass and bending his brows upon me.</p>

<p>Up till now my lady had been standing with her back to
me, but at these words she turned, and we were face to
face. For it may be twenty seconds we stood thus, my
lady proud and cold, I with a tumult of conflicting
emotions in my breast, in which a rapidly rising rage
against her treachery was the more predominant. At
once the clamour around us was stilled into the silence
of a great expectancy.</p>

<p>“This is the man, Captain Barclay,” my lady said
quietly. Then, with her eyes still upon mine, she added:
“I trust, sir, that your wound is on a fair way towards
recovery?”</p>

<p>“Madam,” I answered bitterly, striving to control the
passion in my voice, “awhile ago you accused me of
hypocrisy in that I pitied you. I think that the accusation
might well be reversed. You have openly rebelled
against the government, you have defied the royal authority,
and, for all that I am aware, have slain the
troopers under my command, and, lastly, you have deprived
me, a king’s officer, of my liberty by such base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
trickery as only the heart of a woman could conceive.
You should have been an actress, madam, had fate not
willed you to be born a lady. I congratulate you. Satan
himself might take lessons from you in deceit!” For
a moment she did not speak, and I saw the colour deepen
in her face.</p>

<p>“I fought you with a woman’s weapons,” she answered
coldly—“your manly wit against my woman’s beauty.
If I succeeded, you have but yourself to blame.”</p>

<p>“You say true, madam,” I cried hotly. “For falsehood,
flattery and guile—those are, indeed, a woman’s
weapons—not a gentleman’s!”</p>

<p>“Then by your own words, sir,” she replied icily, “you
do but prove the truth of my assertion.”</p>

<p>“As to the sequel of your scheme, madam,” I continued,
“the shame of it rests rather in success than failure.
To your own conscience I leave it to justify your
conduct. But I have little doubt that long practice
has rendered your ladyship proficient in the art of deception
to which I fell a victim.”</p>

<p>She threw back her proud head and gazed at me with
flashing eyes. “And do you imagine, sir, even for a
moment, that the part I degraded myself into playing
was an easy one!” she replied scornfully. “To expose
myself to the shame of your approval?”</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I answered sternly. “There you are
wrong. For a man’s honest admiration, however humble
his station in life, carries no shame to the woman who
inspires it—were she the highest in the land.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir,” she cried ironically, “spare me your sophistry;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
for honesty coupled with your name is too incongruous.
And let me take this opportunity of informing
you that thanks to your credulity the army of
France, so long delayed, may land in safety on our
shores to-night; and thus, sir, indirectly, you have
hastened the first step that restores the Stuart to the
throne.”</p>

<p>Then raising her voice so that all might hear: “God
save King James!” she cried clearly; and the cry was
enthusiastically caught up both by the gentlemen upon
the terrace and the waiting crowd below.</p>

<p>“And you tell me this, madam?” I said in a choked
voice when the clamour had died away.</p>

<p>She turned upon me with a scornful smile. “If you
think that you can make use of the information, sir, you
are welcome to do so,” she replied. “But I think—and
these gentlemen will bear me witness—that your
present position is scarcely to be envied.” And she
mocked me. Standing there in the pride of her power
and her beauty she mocked me—I, a weak and wounded
prisoner!</p>

<p>“And you are wounded, too,” she continued pitilessly,
“and by one scarce more than a boy—a boy!” she added
with intense scorn. “I think if I remember right, sir,
that you offered me the service of your sword. When I
require such service from any man on my behalf, it shall
be from one who has the wit and strength—aye, and
skill enough to handle it.”</p>

<p>I stood trembling and dumb before her, gazing from
one to the other of the ruthless, mocking faces around<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
me, and back again to my lady’s scornful countenance.
Yet was there no real cause for me to wonder at her
present mood; for deep down in the heart of every
woman—aye, even in the very best of them, there is an
innate well of cruelty, a delight in inflicting pain upon
our sex, which, it may be, is engendered by their physical
inferiority. It was at this moment that, as with a sense
of utter loneliness I faced my encircling enemies, a sudden
faintness seized me. I know not whether it was due
unto my wound, or whether all that I had passed through
had overtaxed my strength, but I staggered back against
the terrace wall. Yet even in that moment I was not so
far unconscious but that I heard an exclamation of pity
escape the lips of Mistress Grace.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I gasped hoarsely—I could bear no more—“let
us end this. Kill me if you will, but for God’s sake
end this!”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir,” she answered quickly. “I will end
it, and spare myself the further insult of your ‘honest
admiration.’ There are depths below depths of infamy
and shame. But if admiration is based upon kindred
qualities of spirit, I can conceive no greater degradation
than to be the object of your passion.” Yet as she spoke
I saw that the colour had forsaken her face and she
pressed her hand against her side, as if in sudden pain.
Aye, others saw it too, for, “Lettice, you are ill!” her
sister cried, hastening to her assistance. But my lady
put her aside.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she cried passionately. “It is nothing—nothing!
Is not this the hour of my triumph? And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
shall I not take it? Shall I not——” She broke off
abruptly with a slight shudder, then with a sudden
change of manner she ran to the terrace wall and beckoned
to the expectant crowd below.</p>

<p>“Look there,” she cried fiercely, flinging out her arm
towards me. “There is the man before whom for many
days we have cowered and trembled, who has held our
safety and our lives in the hollow of his hand; there is
the man who has called himself our master—our master—yours
and mine—mine! Look well upon him
now!”</p>

<p>A fierce shout answered her words and the crowd pressed
forward to the foot of the steps with menacing cries
and curses, in which the voices of the women joined the
loudest.</p>

<p>“Give him to us!” a voice shouted, and the cry was
quickly caught up and repeated. “Aye, give him to us!
To the cliffs with him!”</p>

<p>“To the cliffs, say you?” cried a wild-eyed woman
shrilly, darting up the steps and endeavouring to push
her way past Sampson Dare. “To the gallows with
him! ’Twas such as he that hung my boy to the sign-post
of the inn for following King Monmouth! Aye,
and played their drums the while to drown his dying
cries! This for you—butcher!” She flung a clod of
earth that struck me full in the face, and above the
fierce shout of approval that greeted her words, mingled
with those of “butcher!” and “to the sign-post with
him!” I heard my lady give a hard, cruel laugh at
my discomfiture. Stung more by this than all the indignities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
heaped upon me, I rallied all my strength and
faced them squarely at the head of the steps.</p>

<p>“Peace, you hounds,” I cried sternly. “You who yelp
so loudly now for James would, at a turn of Fortune’s
wheel, bark louder still—for William! Not with such
as you have I to deal. But for you, madam!” I cried
hoarsely, turning to my lady, who stood pale and erect,
her eyes shining with defiance and a light I could not
read—“you, who knowing better, lure these senseless
hinds to ruin with a cunning worthy of yourself and of
your cause—to you, I say, the debt between us is no light
one. Look to yourself in the day that I repay you
for this morning’s work!”</p>

<p>In the vehemence of my passion my wound reopened,
and with the world receding from my fading vision I
fell back senseless in the arms of Sampson Dare.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>OF THE GENTLEMAN ABOARD THE GOOD SHIP “PRIDE OF
DEVON”</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> exactly how long my swoon lasted, to this day I
can but hazard a vague conjecture. But with returning
consciousness I found myself lying upon a heap of
straw in the stable I have before mentioned, with the
steward bending over me busily engaged in re-bandaging
my wound. Beyond him, near to the doorway,
lounged Sampson Dare, and in the yard without I
caught a glimpse of three or four servants belonging
to the manor, all of them fully armed, and of the youth
Martin holding the bridle of my own impatient sorrel.</p>

<p>“So, so,” said the steward grimly, upon seeing me open
my eyes. “King William is spared the mourning for a
valiant servant.”</p>

<p>“And the devil has lost his own—as yet,” added Sampson
Dare with a grin.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes for awhile and lay silent; for the sunlight
without dazzled me, and I was conscious, moreover,
of a feeling of intense weakness, by which I imagined
that I must have lost a quantity of blood—which
was, indeed, the case.</p>

<p>When the man beside me had completed his task, even
to replacing my arm within its former sling, all of
which, to his credit be it said, he accomplished with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
undue harshness, he thrust a flask of spirits in my hand
and bade me curtly, “Drink.”</p>

<p>In this, indeed, I was the more ready to obey him, since
not only was I afflicted with an intolerable thirst, but also
the events of the past few hours recurred swiftly to my
memory, and I was minded to uphold my dignity and
conceal the weakness that I really felt in the presence of
the men before me. Deeply, therefore, I quaffed of the
cognac which the flask contained, drinking in with it
an increased vitality and such returning strength that
presently I was enabled to stagger to my feet.</p>

<p>“That is better,” said the steward, nodding approvingly,
as I was fain to lean for a moment or two longer
against the wall to recover from the sudden faintness
which the effort had entailed; “for the day wears on
apace, and ’tis time we should be moving.”</p>

<p>“Whither?” I gasped hoarsely, glancing from his face
to that of Sampson Dare.</p>

<p>“Ah, you will see time enough,” the latter made answer.
“A pleasant journey to you, with good company!”
and he grinned broadly.</p>

<p>“Come, come, we waste time,” said the steward impatiently,
at the same time beckoning to Martin to
bring my horse nearer. “Can you mount?” he added,
turning abruptly to me.</p>

<p>At that I rallied all my strength, and disregarding his
proffered arm, I stepped—somewhat unsteadily, I will
admit—through the open doorway to the sorrel’s side,
who turned his head at my appearance and whinnied
softly in gentle recognition. But the sight of the animal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
was as if I had found an old friend, and it was with a
renewal of hope that with Sampson Dare’s assistance I
climbed heavily into the saddle. Yet if some wild scheme
of escaping had for a moment crossed my mind it was
speedily doomed to be disappointed; for, with the steward
leading the sorrel by the bridle and with the other men
forming in a little cluster around me, I was forced to
admit to myself, however reluctantly, that any idea of
regaining my liberty was for the present at least impracticable.</p>

<p>Nay, more, as my eyes, travelling from face to face of
the group around me, encountered those of Sampson
Dare, as if reading my thoughts, he significantly patted
a long barrelled pistol in his hand. No, the odds were
too heavy against me in my wounded state, and so, with
a slight shrug, I resigned myself to waiting for what
should follow.</p>

<p>In this order, then, we left the stables behind us and
moved slowly towards the entrance gates of the manor.
Upon turning the corner of the house, we came once
more in full view of the terrace and of the crowd
that still gathered thickly upon the grass below.
Eagerly I looked towards the scene of my late
humiliation.</p>

<p>The gentlemen still lingered upon the terrace and the
two seafaring men awaited our appearance at the foot
of the steps and immediately made their way towards
us; but of my lady herself or of her sister I could see
nothing. And at this I was greatly relieved, for of a
surety I had not courage enough left to me to sustain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
with dignity another interview such as that through
which I had lately passed.</p>

<p>As for the waiting crowd, doubtless it would have gone
hard with me at their hands had I not had the escort of
Sampson Dare and the other stout rogues by my side for
my protection; or it may be that my lady had herself
issued stringent orders as to my safe conduct; for though
upon catching sight of me they immediately thronged
around us, yet they contented themselves with calling
down curses upon me, and beyond this, offered no violent
opposition to our progress. Indeed, they came no
farther with us than the gates of the manor, and upon
turning into the road, we were left to proceed on our
way alone, save for the company of the two seamen
who followed close upon our heels, ever and anon breaking
out into a lusty chorus, which they sang at the
full strength of voices, rendered not too steady by the
spirits they had been freely imbibing. ’Twas a doggerel
verse at best, nathless possessing a jingle that even in
the midst of the anxiety I felt as to my position persistently
forced itself upon my memory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Then a fig for a landsman’s life, my lads—</div>
<div class="indent">And a cheer for the Spanish Main!</div>
<div class="verse">With the still lagoons and the bright doubloons—</div>
<div class="verse">And the black-eyed maids of Spain, my lads!</div>
<div class="indent">Oho, for the maids of Spain!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>To this accompaniment we arrived in no long time at
the village, and passing slowly down the deserted street,
wended our way to the little stone jetty that lay behind
the court-house; that is, all save the two worthies who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
had followed us, who stopped to further refresh themselves
at the inn.</p>

<p>Swiftly I glanced seawards. Less than a mile off
shore lay the mysterious vessel I had seen from the cliffs;
and the sight confirmed the suspicions I already had in
my mind as to my further destination. Moreover, as,
obedient to a curt command from Sampson Dare, I
slowly dismounted on the pier, I took occasion of the
steward to inquire whither we were bound.</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, as if debating with himself
whether he should satisfy my curiosity; but apparently
concluding it could do not harm, his face relaxed into
a grim smile.</p>

<p>“To France,” he replied briefly.</p>

<p>“France?” I cried, unable under the sudden surprise
to conceal the dismay his words caused me.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered sourly, enjoying my too evident
confusion. “The prospect does not please
you? Well, I think that the galleys will more
than counterbalance this.” And he lightly touched his
neck.</p>

<p>I would have questioned him still further but that the
captain and the mate arrived at this moment upon the
jetty just as a boat put off from the vessel’s side and
made rapidly for the spot where we were standing. But
at sight of the boat, or rather I supposed, finding no boat
ready waiting for us, the captain, who I saw at a glance
was decidedly the worse for liquor, broke out into a
string of horrid curses, which ceased only for lack of
breath. With face inflamed and gait unsteady he advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
to the end of the jetty and awaited its nearer
approach.</p>

<p>“You rogues!” he roared, as the object of his rage
came alongside and the two evil-looking faces of the seamen
who manned it were raised to his. “You scum!
You devil-spawn! You must return to the ship without
orders, must ye! And keep your betters waiting, must
ye!—Burn my body! but I’ll teach ye discipline when I
get aboard!”</p>

<p>Then in a fresh access of drunken fury he turned
suddenly upon me, and drawing a pistol from his belt
waved it towards the waiting boat below. “Get in, you
dog!” he shouted brutally. I glanced at the faces of
the men around me. In no one of them did I see aught
but satisfaction at my departure. So, with the prospect
of escape at present receding, I shrugged my shoulders
lightly, and disdaining further speech of them, I seated
myself in the bow of the boat.</p>

<p>Scarcely had I ensconced myself ere the captain and
the mate took their places in the stern, the captain still
with the pistol upon his knees.</p>

<p>“Shove off and be damned to ye!” he roared. “And
put your backs to it if you would not wish a bullet in
ye!”</p>

<p>Obedient to his command, the men bent to their oars in
sullen silence—a silence all too plainly born of fear—and
we headed for the distant vessel—and a prison.</p>

<p>As the distance between the boat and the shore behind
us gradually increased I took my last look of Cleeve.
The evening was fast drawing on and already the cloud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
shadows lay in darkened patches upon the green slopes
of Cleevesborough, though all around us the sea shimmered
golden in the glory of the sinking sun. Behind
us, the little group of figures upon the jetty still lingered,
staring after us—the sorrel in their midst. And
so still was the evening air that even at that distance
their voices came plainly to my ears across the widening
water. Away to the right, above the dark woods
that crowned the rugged cliffs, I caught sight of the tall
chimneys of the manor that had proved so sorry a grave
to my ambitions. Bitter were my thoughts as I gazed
upon it. A week ago had seen me in the plenitude of
power—master of the manor and of all beneath its roof.
Now I sat in the gathering night shadows—a helpless,
dishonoured prisoner, every stroke of the oars speeding
me nearer to France and to the galleys. And the cause
of it all—a woman!</p>

<p>All this time the captain in the stern had not been
silent—now cursing at the seamen for their tardiness,
anon breaking out into snatches of the song I had before
heard:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And the black-eyed maids of Spain, my lads!</div>
<div class="verse">Oho! for the maids of Spain!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Presently I turned my attention to the vessel we were
rapidly approaching. Certainly the appearance of the
captain and the crew were not prepossessing, and confirmed
me in the opinion that she was a privateer,—most
likely hailing from Bristol—one of those free lances
of the ocean fitted out by wealthy Jacobites to assist
the cause of James; but which—such was the unsettled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
state of the times—preyed upon all merchant shipping
alike with strict impartiality.</p>

<p>The ship proved to be a larger craft upon nearer approach
than I had first imagined. She lay motionless
upon the water, stern on towards us, and her tapering
spars and tracery of ropes stood darkly out against
the evening sky. As we swept round to larboard, above
the cabin window in her stern I saw her name, <i>The
Scourge</i>. At the same time I caught sight of a score
or more of villainous faces gazing at us from above the
bulwarks of her low, black hull, from which, here and
there, the frowning muzzles of her guns protruded. But
small time had I for speculation upon her character,
for no sooner were we alongside—and it was not without
considerable difficulty that I gained the deck—than the
captain turned fiercely upon the first of the two sailors
who had followed us aboard.</p>

<p>“That for disobeying orders, you dog!” he cried,
snatching a pistol from his belt and striking the fellow
so shrewd a blow with the heavy butt that the rogue
fell to the deck half stunned.</p>

<p>“Up with ye!” he added, bestowing a brutal kick upon
the man’s prostrate body. “No skulking here while Barclay’s
in command. Though, curse me! a more humane
man than I never left Bristol port!”</p>

<p>More I was not permitted to see or hear, for at a
word from the mate, a couple of the ruffians seized me,
and forcing me down a narrow companion ladder aft,
flung open a door at its foot and thrust me inside with
unnecessary violence; and I heard the shooting of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
heavy bolts behind them. At first, I could distinguish
nothing of my surroundings, but after a few moments,
when my eyes had grown accustomed to the gloom, I
made out that I was in a small cabin some seven feet
square, destitute of all furniture, but with a narrow
wooden locker at one end. Such light and air as there
was—if light it could be called, which was at best but
semi-darkness—came from a narrow slit, six inches
high—not more, above the door. As for the heat of the
place, ’twas stifling, for be it remembered it was now the
very height of summer, and the little air there was below
deck stole through the open companion way down
which we had come. I raised my hand above me and
found that I could touch with ease the massive timbers
overhead. Being a tall man, as I have previously stated,
I also found that with comparatively little difficulty I
could raise my face to the level of the slit above the
door. But there was little to reward my curiosity. I
could see, indeed, the companion ladder without and a
narrow passage to my left running into the gloom,
which I conjectured to lead to the cabins astern, but
that was all.</p>

<p>I next turned my attention to the door itself. It was
of stout timber, far too strong to be broken open by anything
short of an axe and fastened, moreover, by the
bolts that I had heard drawn. Presently, therefore, I
desisted from my inspection, and seating myself upon
the locker, I gave myself up to my reflections. The light
grew feebler and feebler in the cabin, until at length
it died out altogether, and I was left in the darkness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
speculate upon the strange adversities of fortune. As
for the steward’s threat of the galleys, I swore desperately
to myself that such a fate should not be mine,
though as yet I could see no glimmer of light as to how
I was to accomplish my escape. One thing I had in my
favour. The vessel was yet at anchor and remembering
the fact of the stillness of the evening air, I thought it
unlikely that a breeze would spring up for many hours,
so that there was time before me wherein to formulate a
plan.</p>

<p>It was not until some two hours later that I saw a
light glimmer upon the ceiling of the cabin and heard a
heavy step descending the ladder. A moment later the
bolts were withdrawn and the mate himself appeared in
the doorway. In one hand he carried a lantern, which
he held up the better to view me. He was followed by
a boy bearing a coarse brown loaf and a pitcher of
water. These the latter set upon the boards and withdrew.
Yet the mate lingered for a moment, making pretence
of waiting to see if I should speak.</p>

<p>“There is your supper,” he said at length, finding that
I kept silent.</p>

<p>“’Tis coarse enough fare,” I said abruptly, “and quite
in keeping with your lodging.”</p>

<p>“Yet be content,” he answered, “’tis better than that
of your men.”</p>

<p>“Ah, they are aboard, then?” I said quickly; for up till
now I had been so taken up with considering my own
position that I had scarcely given a thought to
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>“In irons,” he answered, grinning. “And you, too, had
we another set aboard.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” I replied nonchalantly, concealing the trepidation
his words caused me. “There are worse things, my
friend, and it is not far to France.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho!” he chuckled. “To France—no! It is
not far to France, as you say.”</p>

<p>Something in the man’s words—in his face—caused me
a vague uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Hark you, master mate,” I said sharply. “I am your
prisoner; why not be frank with me?—You have been
paid to carry us to France, is it not so?”</p>

<p>“What, then?” he replied slowly. “A poor sailorman
must live. There’s a market for such stout knaves as
you any day—in Algiers!”</p>

<p>And without further word he closed and bolted the door
behind him, and I heard his heavy footsteps ascend the
ladder, and left me in the darkness. But if I had been
anxious to escape before, his last words made me doubly
so. All too clearly I understood his meaning. The villains
had not scrupled to accept the money paid by my
lady or her Jacobite friends for our removal, but were
now meditating selling us into a slavery a hundred times
worse than death itself, thus making for themselves a
double profit. For how long I sat there in the darkness,
revolving this and all that had led up to it I do not
know. At length, worn out by the excitement and events
of the day through which I had passed, I stretched myself
upon the hard boards, and with my coat for a pillow
fell into a heavy slumber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>For many hours I must have slept the sleep of exhaustion,
for the light was glimmering faintly upon the
beams overhead when I awoke to a full consciousness of
my surroundings. Also I discovered at once that we
were at sea, for the vessel was rolling heavily. Overhead
I could hear the trampling of feet and the captain’s
voice roaring out hoarse commands. But no one
came near me, and for hours I waited in solitude revolving
a scheme in my brain which every moment took shape
more clearly. True it was a chance only, and a forlorn
one, yet I could see no other way, and desperate men
do not stick at trifles.</p>

<p>The idea then came to me fully at noon, when again
the door was unbolted to admit the boy and the tall mate
with a repetition of the coarse fare of the preceding
night. But it was necessary for the execution of my
plan that I should wait for the friendly covering of
darkness, so I huddled myself upon the locker and
feigned to be overcome by the rolling of the ship. The
mate looked at me carelessly.</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, ho!” he cried with a grin. “Hast lost thy sea
legs, man? Why, my bully, ’tis a capful of wind this—scarce
fit to call a breeze.”</p>

<p>To this I replied with a groan by way of answer, sinking
my head more forward that he might not see my
face; and with a few ribald jests at my expense he presently
left me in solitude.</p>

<p>When the door had again closed I fell to upon the
food that they had brought me. Coarse though it was, I
had need of all my strength for the task before me. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
as it was, in the first place, essential for me to escape
from the cabin, I had resolved to attempt a sudden rush
when next they should bring me my supper, trusting to
luck to find some means of leaving the vessel in the darkness
and confusion. ’Twas a madman’s scheme at best,
but I dared delay no longer, for every hour carried me
farther from the shores of England. Weapon I had
none, but I had caught a glimpse of a long knife in the
mate’s belt, and could I but get possession of this, I
vowed I would not be retaken without a struggle. Also
I was handicapped heavily by the wound in my breast,
that had stiffened the muscles of my shoulder, leaving
me with but the partial use of my left arm. And, again,
there was the boy to be reckoned with. But anything
was better than to tamely submit to be sold into slavery,
and hope of liberty is a great factor in renewing
strength and courage.</p>

<p>Moreover, I reflected, if what my lady had said was
true, the safety of England might lie in my hands.</p>

<p>How long the hours seemed to me until the light began
to fade in the cabin can well be imagined; but gradually
it grew less and less, and was I deceived, or was it really
a thin mist that came floating down the hatchway and
penetrated to my prison cell? My heart gave a great
leap—’twas sure a heaven sent boon to cloak my escape.
And ere the light had quite faded a new inspiration came
to me. I was still wearing my heavy military boots that
reached above my knee, although my spurs had been removed,
belike by one of the servants at the manor. I
now drew these off that I might be the lighter upon my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
feet and also the more silent, and the thought came to me
that one of them would form no bad missile with which
to preface my attack. Nay, I trusted that the first
surprise would be so great that I should secure the knife
with but little difficulty and then—well, liberty is dear
to the heart of every man. So I waited alone in the
darkness with every nerve strung for the coming encounter,
listening to the creaking of the ship’s timbers
and the faint shouts of command from the deck overhead.
And at last there came a gleam of light above
the doorway, and I heard the mate’s step upon the ladder.
Once he slipped ere he reached the bottom and I heard
him curse loudly.</p>

<p>I rose at that, and with the boot in my hand awaited the
opening of the door. But Fortune, that had of late
played me so many scurvy tricks, was surely anxious to
make amends to me that night, for upon the bolts being
withdrawn, the door swung slowly open and disclosed the
figure of the mate only. He had set the lantern upon
the floor at his feet and in his left hand carried my coarse
night fare. Without troubling to raise the light so as
to satisfy himself as to my condition, he took two steps
into the cabin and stooped to place the food upon the
floor. But that was his undoing; for hastily changing
my original intention, as the rogue bent down I swung
the boot aloft, and with all the strength of arm and body
brought down the heavy heel upon his head. Without
cry or groan he flung his arms wide and fell an inert
heap at my feet. In a moment I had thrown myself upon
him—my hands upon his throat. But there was little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
need for me to exert any pressure there, the fellow lay
as motionless as a log. And when, a moment later, I released
my grip and slightly raised his head, it fell again
with a dull thud upon the boards. Not till then did I
rise to my feet, my first care being to secure the lantern,
and with this in my hand I re-entered the cabin and carefully
closed the door behind me. Then I again bent
over my prisoner. A very brief examination sufficed to
assure me that the fellow was but stunned; and securing
his knife, I bound his arms firmly behind his back with
his own belt; and with a strip torn from the sleeve of his
shirt and his red cap I made an effectual gag. This
done, I propped him against the locker. Then blowing
out the lantern, I crept from the cabin. Once outside in
the passage, I shot the heavy bolts behind me and stood
still for a moment listening.</p>

<p>Not a sound came to show that the mate’s fall had been
heard from the deck, though I could hear voices raised as
though in altercation, and I knew that it would not be
long before his absence was discovered. ’Twas almost
dark where I stood, at the foot of the ladder, clutching
the knife in my hand, every nerve in my body braced to
meet whatever should befall. Overhead, a lighter patch
in the gloom indicated the hatchway. As my eyes grew
more accustomed to my surroundings, I made out that
the only other exit was by way of the narrow passage
on my left, that led, I felt assured, to the cabin astern.
Yet I was reluctant to abandon my men without making
some effort to liberate them, even though, from
what the mate had said, I knew them to be in irons somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
in the forepart of the ship. I should, indeed, have
ventured upon some desperate scheme for their release—which
would assuredly have led to my own undoing—nay,
I had already ascended the ladder, and my head was
all but on a level with the deck—enough so, indeed, to
show me that a thin damp mist wrapped the ship in its
embrace, so that of the masts and spars above little was
discernible—when on a sudden from the deck above came
the hoarse voice of Captain Barclay.</p>

<p>“Forward there!” he roared. “Where is the mate?
Send him aft, one o’ ye!”</p>

<p>’Twas a question of minutes only ere his plight was
discovered. I turned on the instant, and darting down
the ladder, sped swiftly along the narrow passage opposite,
to where a faint light shone from beneath a door
at the farther end. I did not stop to consider what
might lie behind it, but taking a firmer grip of the
knife, I flung open the door. A single glance showed
me the cabin was empty. Swiftly I closed the door and
shot the heavy bolt that fastened it, then glanced quickly
around me.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“A very brief examination sufficed to assure me that the
fellow was but stunned”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A single oil lamp swung from a beam in the centre,
faintly illuminating the interior. It shone upon the
small square table immediately below it, littered with the
remains of a meal, and upon a few articles of clothing,
tossed carelessly upon the sleeping bunk, as well as upon
a few old-fashioned pistols and hangers. But ’twas to
the window that I turned my attention, flinging it open
and gazing out into the night. One quick glance I gave,
then an exclamation of thankfulness rose to my lips. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
was, indeed, the stern cabin of the ship, and the light
shone out upon a white wall of vapour; for the sea fog
was thickening fast. But it was not that only that had
fired me with hope; ’twas the sight of a rope cleaving
the mist; and peering down, I made out the dim outline
of a boat towing astern.</p>

<p>On a sudden, as I leaned far out of the window and
grasped the rope with both hands, the deep voice of the
man at the helm above me broke out into the song I knew
so well:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“With the still lagoons and the bright doubloons—</div>
<div class="verse">And the black-eyed maids of Spain, my lads!</div>
<div class="indent">Oho! for the maids of Spain!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then after a pause: “Curse this mist!” I heard him
mutter. And precisely at this moment came a thundering
knock upon the cabin door behind me and a gruff voice
calling upon the mate to open.</p>

<p>’Twas no time to hesitate; at the risk of being seen by
the helmsman above me—at the risk of my wound reopening—I
launched myself out upon my frail support
and let myself down into the darkness.</p>

<p>It seemed an eternity ere my feet touched the bow of
the boat below, but once I had clambered aboard a few
strokes of my knife served to sever the rope, and a moment
later the light in the cabin of the <i>Scourge</i> disappeared
into the fog, leaving me alone upon the waste of
waters. Not till then did I seize the oars, and pulling the
boat’s head round commence to row gently in the opposite
direction to that which the vessel had taken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>Blacker and blacker closed the night around me, until
I could scarcely see the full length of the boat. Presently
the mist changed into rain, that grew ever in
volume until I was soon drenched to the skin. In this
condition, worn out and shivering in my wet clothes, I
continued for many hours, until gradually a numbness
began to steal over me. In vain I struggled against it.
Slowly it grew upon me despite my efforts, until at
length, careless of what fate might befall me, I stretched
myself in the bottom of the boat and lapsed into unconsciousness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“Boat ahoy!”</p>

<p>The cry came pealing across the water and was still
ringing in my ears when my scattered senses returned to
me. I raised my head above the thwart and gazed about
me, as yet but half awakened. Darkness had given place
to a grey and misty dawn and the rain had ceased
to fall. But almost immediately my eyes fell upon that
which effectually aroused me.</p>

<p>At a short distance away a small brig lay to upon the
water, a dozen curious faces looking down upon me from
the low bulwarks. Upon the raised poop astern two men
were standing, gazing earnestly in my direction. One
was short and thick set, with sailor written plainly upon
his weather-beaten countenance. The other was to all
appearance a gentleman, though his tall figure was concealed
by a long riding coat; and I could see little of his
face beneath his richly laced hat. ’Twas the shorter of
the two who had hailed me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>“Ahoy!” he cried again in stentorian tones. “Can ye
row aboard?”</p>

<p>At that I shouted back an assent; though exhaustion
had so wrought upon me that my voice was strangely
weak; and again betaking myself to the oars, I gained at
length the vessel’s side, where a dozen friendly hands
assisted me aboard. The tall gentleman had disappeared
from the poop, but his companion, whom I took to be the
master of the ship, came forward to receive me. He
quickly cut short my few stammered expressions of gratitude.
“Presently, presently!” he said, eyeing me closely.
“Why, y’are wet to the skin, man, and fit subject for an
ague. Here,” he cried, beckoning to two of the seamen
standing near, “take him below and rig him out
amongst ye! No, no,” he continued not unkindly, seeing
that I was about to speak, “y’are on my ship, man, and
needs must obey orders! Afterwards you may tell your
tale.” And he turned upon his heel.</p>

<p>I said no more, but followed the seamen down into the
forecastle, where, after receiving a somewhat motley
change of garments, together with a stiff pannikin of
cognac, I felt little the worse for my night’s adventure.
From the seamen themselves I could gain but little information,
save that the brig was the <i>Pride of Devon</i>,
three days out from Kinsale, and bound for Southampton,
and that she had been considerably delayed by the
thick fog prevailing the previous day. Upon all other
subjects they were strangely reticent, so that I presently
gave up questioning them and signified my readiness to
accompany them on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>On arriving there I saw the figure of the master awaiting
me at the foot of the poop ladder; but to my
astonishment, upon my approaching he laid a finger upon
his lips, and advancing to the door of a cabin, which I
had not noticed beneath the poop, he threw it open and
signed to me to enter.</p>

<p>I did so, wondering.</p>

<p>’Twas a small room, yet somewhat larger than the size
of the brig itself promised. In the centre was a table,
upon which a repast was already spread; and at this
table was seated the gentleman I had previously
seen.</p>

<p>He rose at my entrance and made me a courtly bow;
then for a moment we gazed at each other in silence.
He was, I think, the handsomest man I have ever seen—with
regular features and fair moustache matching in
colour with his court peruke. He had laid aside his
hat, though I noted with surprise that he still wore his
plain dark riding coat tightly buttoned, concealing all
of his dress beneath save a pair of spurred riding boots.
Of fully my own height, he may have been somewhat
older in years; but it was rather the lofty look of mingled
pride and command upon his face that caught and
rivetted the eye. Here was a born leader of men I told
myself, one accustomed to exact obedience, and possessing
a fiery and indomitable will. No poverty of
dress could conceal the latent power suppressed within,
or the grace of movement that spoke equally of noble
birth.</p>

<p>“Do I address the owner of this vessel?” I said bluntly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
For a moment I thought that a faint smile flickered upon
his face.</p>

<p>“For the present at least, sir,” he answered quietly, “I
think that I may safely claim that title.”</p>

<p>“Then permit me to tender you my sincere thanks for
your timely assistance, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>He raised his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Nay, ’tis unnecessary,” he replied. “Important as
time is to me at present, humanity would forbid me deserting
a fellow-being in such distress, and,” he added,
with a piercing glance, “if I mistake not, a fellow-soldier.”</p>

<p>“Of some little experience,” I answered proudly.</p>

<p>“Why, then,” he replied, smiling, “I was about to break
my fast, sir, when your boat was sighted. Permit me to
play the part of host, and we will fight the battles of the
world together.” And he waived me courteously to a
seat.</p>

<p>I bowed in acceptance, and sat down to the table
with mingled feelings, foremost among which was one
of puzzled bewilderment. For minute by minute it was
borne in on me that I had met this gentleman before,
though I could not place him in my memory. Yet something
in his features, in his grace of manner, seemed
strangely familiar, reminding me of some one I had
lately met. But of whom? And where?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>OF THE LONELY HUT ON THE SHORE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> I should do full justice to the ample meal before
me after my scanty fare of the past two days was not to
be wondered at. Meantime, my host chatted pleasantly
upon general subjects, more especially upon the wars in
Flanders, in which I gathered he had studied the art of
war under the great Turenne. Here was a subject upon
which, as soldiers, we could both grow enthusiastic; and
we exchanged mutual reminiscences of that great man—conceded
to be the most celebrated general of his age.
At length, when the wine was put before us, I said
slowly:</p>

<p>“Doubtless you are curious to learn, sir, how I came
to be in the position from which you rescued me?”</p>

<p>“As to that,” he replied, “seeing that I cannot at present
return the like confidence as regards myself, I can respect
your reticence. Enough that we are followers of
the same profession. War is a common mistress for
uniting her devotees all the world over.”</p>

<p>Yet glancing across at him, I felt that he deserved
some further explanation, though I resolved not to reveal
the whole truth. Little did I guess that had I indeed
done so, the whole future course of my life would have
been changed. Little did I dream what strange vagary
Fate was playing me there in that little cabin with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
grey light of morning falling upon the handsome face
of the man before me!</p>

<p>“Nay,” I said carelessly, “’tis a common story enough.
I escaped yesterday from a rascally privateer, upon
which I had been entrapped.”</p>

<p>“They are the curse of the seas!” he said impetuously.
“’Tis a sign of the times and a scandal to our navy that
such hornets are permitted to sail with impunity. Even
upon our own Devon coast I have known men to have
been kidnapped for the plantations.”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, as if he had said too much, and
I saw a shade of annoyance for a moment upon his face.
But on my own part, though I pretended to see nothing,
I was quick to notice his confusion; and toying with
my glass, I replied:</p>

<p>“I learn, sir, from the seamen that this vessel is bound
for Southampton; had it been at all possible, I would
fain have landed in Devonshire.”</p>

<p>“Nothing is easier,” he responded. “My own destination
is Teignmouth; if this will suit your convenience,
you are welcome to accompany me ashore.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I made answer, “you are a very courteous gentleman,
and right gladly do I accept your offer.”</p>

<p>He bent his head in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“Then that is settled,” he replied gaily, with a wave
of the hand, as if dismissing the subject. “For the rest,
I fear I do but play the host indifferently. Your glass
is empty, permit me to replenish it. And now, sir, what
think you of Luxembourg’s qualities as a general?”</p>

<p>Thereupon we plunged once more into a discussion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
the campaigns in Flanders, upon which subject I
found my companion to have an intimate knowledge; so
that it was not until nearly an hour later that we
ascended to the deck. We there found a distinct change
for the better in the appearance of the weather. A fitful
gleam of sunshine stole occasionally through the heavy
grey clouds and the mist was gradually clearing from
the surface of the water. Away to the north, a dark
streak of land was faintly discernible, which the master
speedily informed us was the distant coast of Devon.
But the wind had fallen considerably and the little vessel
forged but slowly through the water. One thing I
could not help but notice—the unusual deference paid by
the master to my companion; confirming me in my opinion
as to his rank and quality. All morning, indeed, we
sailed slowly along the coast, seeing no other vessel, for
at this time the fear of the French kept our merchantmen
to the harbours, save when a goodly number could be
conveyed by a fleet of men-of-war. And with every
hour I could see that my companion’s impatience to
reach our destination visibly increased. Though still
preserving his courteous demeanour towards me, a dozen
times, at least, I heard him demand of the master whether
sail could not be increased. But the latter only shook his
head, and noon found us some four miles south of Prawle
Point. It was shortly afterwards that we descended to
the cabin to dine; but our meal was not concluded ere we
were again summoned to the deck by the report of a suspicious
sail. My companion rose at once, and together
we ascended to the poop, where we found the master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
anxiously scanning a sail that showed plainly through
the mist some ten miles to the southward. Nor had we
ourselves escaped observation, for even as we stood
watching, the vessel’s course was changed and she bore
down upon us.</p>

<p>My companion turned to the master with a mute inquiry
in his eyes.</p>

<p>The latter shook his head with a lugubrious air. “’Tis
not, yon vessel will prove to be some rascally French
picaroon. Were there more wind I would not fear the
result; but I misdoubt gentlemen, whether we shall see
Teignmouth this trip.”</p>

<p>The gentleman at my side uttered an exclamation of
annoyance.</p>

<p>“But our bargain, captain?” he cried quickly. “You
have been paid to carry me to Teignmouth, and a bargain
is a bargain.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” the other answered doggedly; “and a life is a
life; and what think ye would ours be worth should yonder
rascals run us aboard? No, no, Exmouth is our
only refuge, for there is a king’s ship in the harbour—and
Lord send that we see it safely!”</p>

<p>In vain my companion remonstrated with him, the fellow
was as stubborn as a rock. And in the light of recent
events I could not but admit the justice of his
decision. One concession only would he agree to make—to
run in shore as close as possible and to provide us with
a boat, by which my companion and I might leave the
ship if we so desired.</p>

<p>Slowly the afternoon wore away as the chase continued.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
With every hour the sun shone out more
radiantly, its level beams falling full upon the white canvas
of our pursuing foe; and upon an ominous row of
guns that boded ill for the brig if it were overtaken.
From time to time my companion fell to thoughtfully
pacing the deck, at others he would take the master
aside, as if to learn his opinion as to our chances of escape.
As for me, I had no desire to intrude upon his
privacy or to seem curious as to the reason for his evident
anxiety. I withdrew, therefore, to the stern, and
leaning upon the low bulwarks, fell into conversation
with the man at the helm.</p>

<p>He was a rough, weather-beaten old seadog and was
willing enough to respond to my advances and to impart
me information.</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” he said in reply to a question I put him.
“She will catch us sure enough ere we reach Exmouth,
if so be as the king’s ship hear not the sound of our
guns.”</p>

<p>He glanced as he spoke with sailorly pride at a few
antiquated pieces of brass cannon that had to me the
appearance of the veriest toys. “Take my advice, master,”
he added in a lower tone, so that no one but myself
might hear, “leave the ship if ye have the chance;
’tis a deal the safer.”</p>

<p>A moment later his mahogany face resumed its ordinary
blank expression, as a quick step sounded behind
me, and turning swiftly, I found my host at my elbow.</p>

<p>“The time has come, sir,” he said quietly, “to determine
our future course of action. For my own part, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
have decided to leave the vessel, but I would not unduly
influence your own decision. Should you consider yourself
safer on board, you are at full liberty to remain.”</p>

<p>I flung a quick glance around me. Dusk had fallen,
but some two miles away loomed the rugged cliffs of
Torbay. Astern the pursuing vessel had crept up to
within three miles of us. My mind was speedily made up.</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I made answer, “I shall be pleased
to accompany you; though I fear, sir, that you will find
me more of an encumbrance in the boat than otherwise.”
And I briefly informed him of my wound. But he
waived aside all my objections, and after a few moments’
earnest conversation with the master he retraced his
steps to my side.</p>

<p>“In five minutes’ time, sir, a boat will be provided for
our departure. If you have any preparations to make, I
pray you then to be in readiness.”</p>

<p>He bowed as he spoke and descended the ladder to the
little cabin to collect I supposed his own belongings;
as for me, I went below to the forecastle and donned once
more the clothes I had worn when I first came on board.
This done, I made my way on deck. Swift as I had been
in the process, I found my companion already awaiting
me with visible impatience upon his countenance. To
my muttered apology he took no heed, but stepped to
where a boat was already lowered alongside.</p>

<p>“At your convenience,” he said, with a waive of his
hand towards the stern.</p>

<p>“But,” I replied hesitatingly, “there is but room for
two. You do not mean——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>He shrugged his shoulders negligently.</p>

<p>“Our friend here is already shorthanded, therefore for
the nonce I must be my own oarsman. Have no fear,
however, on that account,” he added with a smile, as I
broke out into a few words of remonstrance. “’Tis not
the first time I have handled an oar, though I must confess
to being of late years sadly out of practice.”</p>

<p>He seated himself as he spoke, and without further
delay I took the place assigned to me, and with a
few words of kindly leave-taking and advice from the
rough seamen above us—which my companion courteously
acknowledged by raising his laced hat—the
rope was cast off and the little vessel forged rapidly
ahead.</p>

<p>To me there was something strange and incongruous in
the sight of this gentleman with his aristocratic face and
bearing and his shapely white hands—upon one of which
I descried a magnificent ruby—yet plying the oars with
the skill of one accustomed to such exercise. For the
rest, we had covered but half the distance when the pursuing
vessel passed us little more than a mile astern;
but to our satisfaction she did not alter her course, but
held on in pursuit of the brig. It was growing rapidly
dark when we approached the cliffs, and passed slowly
along them, seeking some break in their granite barrier
where we might safely land. The unusual exertion I
could see was telling upon my companion, though he
resolutely refused to allow me to change places with him,
and presently we came upon such a place as we sought.
Two tongues of rock jutting crescent-shape from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
base of the cliff left a clear space between them some ten
feet wide, through which the tide poured with the fury of
a millrace. Inside this rocky opening it widened into a
little bay, the whole forming a natural harbour, ending
in a white pebbly beach. So much we could see,
but no more; and without hesitation my companion
pulled for the narrow entrance on the crest of a huge
roller. We had reached it, were all but through, I had
opened my lips to congratulate him upon his skill when
he uttered a shout of warning. Whether we had miscalculated
the width of the opening in the deeper
shadows cast by the cliff, or whether my companion’s oar
struck against a sunken rock I do not know, but on a
sudden the boat capsized, and I found myself struggling
in the water. Of the next few moments I have but a confused
recollection, for I am no swimmer. I know that
the wave swept me forward, that I went under, rose to
the surface sank again, and the next moment my feet
touched the bottom, and I found myself gasping waist
deep in the water. I dashed the water from my eyes and
made for the beach. A little to my right I saw the
dark outline of the boat floating bottom upwards. At
the same moment a heavy object struck against my
knees, all but sweeping me from my feet, and glancing
downwards, I saw the white face of my companion,
white, but with a crimson splash upon his forehead. I
caught his arm and with set teeth braced myself to meet
the back wash. When this had passed, I raised my companion’s
inert form in my arms and staggered up the
beach beyond reach of the water. Then I laid my burden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
down and stooped to examine his injuries. He was
quite insensible and was bleeding profusely from a long,
ragged cut upon the temple, inflicted, doubtless, by a
sunken rock or by the boat itself when it capsized. Nor
for all my efforts could I restore him to consciousness.
Once, indeed, as I bound up the cut with the scarf taken
from his neck, he groaned slightly, and bending
my head closer—for the darkness had deepened around
us—I fancied that I saw his eyelids quiver. But he
speedily lapsed once more into total unconsciousness, so
that I began to fear that his injuries might be severer
than I had at first imagined. ’Twas essential, above all
things, that I should procure assistance, and that
speedily, ere it became quite dark. Accordingly I rose
to my feet and took a rapid survey of my surroundings.
On either side of me towered the rugged cliffs, but in
front the beach gave way to a narrow valley—one of
those bosky coombes so common to the coast of Devon.
I started to ascend it, therefore, and scarcely had I advanced
a quarter of a mile than I was overjoyed to see a
light shining through the trees. Towards this I directed
my steps, and presently found myself standing upon
the edge of a little clearing in the centre of which stood
a rude hut. By this time the moon had risen above the
torrs, and in its clear light, a short distance away, I saw
a white road running past the head of the coombe. From
the hut itself came the sound of hammering, with now
and again a snatch of song. I lost no time in approaching
and knocking with my clenched fist upon the door.
At the sound both song and hammering died away, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
a moment later the door was opened and disclosed the figure
of the singer.</p>

<p>He was a little old man, dressed in rough fisherman’s
attire and with the most prominent eyes I had ever seen.
Indeed, his whole appearance gave me the impression that
he was not overburdened with wits. The interior of the
hut was of the poorest description. On the one side I
caught sight of a half-finished boat, upon which the fellow
had been engaged when I had disturbed him. Upon
the other was a couch of dried fern leaves. This, together
with a rough table and stool and a litter of nets,
seemed to sum up the total of his property. Yet when
I had given him a hurried explanation, he readily consented
to return with me for my companion, and a minute
later we were striding down the coombe side by side.
I gathered on the way that we had landed upon the
northern coast of Torbay, and that Cleeve itself lay little
more than two miles distant. I learned also that two
days before a French fleet of six sail of the line had put
into the bay, but that upon the approach of a British
squadron they had sailed hurriedly for the coast of
France, so that all danger of invasion was at present at
an end.</p>

<p>“Ah,” thought I, “so, my lady, your pretty scheme has
failed, and the wheel of fortune turns once more in my
favour!” We found my companion still lying in the
same position in which I had left him, and raising him in
our arms, bore him with difficulty—for he was no light
weight and the trees were thick—back to the hut. But it
was upon reaching this latter, and depositing our senseless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
burden upon the bed of ferns that fate culminated in
the strangest trick of all. For no sooner did the old man
beside me catch sight of my companion’s face in the light
of the rushlight fixed to the wall than he uttered a
startled exclamation.</p>

<p>“Lord save us!” he cried. “’Tis the master himself.”</p>

<p>“How, fellow!” I said in surprise. “You know this
gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye,” he answered, scarce finding his tongue.
“Know him? I have lived this forty years upon his
land.”</p>

<p>“Then who is he?” I cried, no suspicion of the truth
dawning upon my mind. “Speak out, man?”</p>

<p>“You do not know?” he stammered. “You do not
know the Earl of Cleeve?”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>In my surprise I gripped his arm so tightly that he
cried out in sudden pain, and wrenching himself free,
caught up his hammer and put the table between us.
But as for me I had forgotten the fellow’s very presence,
and stood staring down into the white face of the man
before me with but two thoughts gradually dawning
upon my stunned senses; for if this man’s words were
true, then this—this—was the Earl of Cleeve, and my
lady’s brother. As all the possibilities of what this latter
phrase might mean to be flashed suddenly upon my mind
I could have shouted aloud in my elation. It was not
that I knew this man’s name to be proscribed, it was not
for the sake of the reward offered by government for his
capture, though that alone might have tempted a more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
sordid man than I—no, it was the knowledge that I held
his secret and his life in the hollow of my hand—that now
at last I would have a full and final reckoning with my
lady. At last! Oh, I would wring that proud heart! I
would humble that haughty spirit to the very dust! I
would crush her without pity or remorse! She should
plead—kneel—nay, grovel at my feet—for the life that
I would refuse!</p>

<p>We had parted last with but little seeming hope for me
to obtain revenge; now all the cards were in my hand,
and the man whom she had scorned, despised, and
struck—struck!—I swore a bitter oath at the remembrance—had
power to bring ruin upon her house and
make her taste the bitterness of death!</p>

<p>As I conjured up the picture of that proud head bowed
low in sorrow, I laughed aloud in my exultation. Then
my eyes encountered those of the owner of the hut, who
still remained in the same attitude, suspiciously regarding
me, and I came back to earth with a sudden start.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” I said contemptuously. “I will do you no
hurt, man! See, I am in a merry mood!—a right merry
mood!” And again I laughed exultantly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he muttered, crossing himself, “but ’tis merriment
that is not good to hear.”</p>

<p>I paid no further attention to him, but bent low over my
companion’s prostrate form and looked long and
earnestly in his face. Now I understood at a glance the
likeness to some one that at our first meeting had so puzzled
me; now on a sudden I remembered of whom the
voice and manners had reminded me. Surely I had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
blind not to see before the likeness to my lady. Even as
I gazed at him the colour returned slightly to his cheeks,
and his lips parted in a scarcely audible sigh. I sank
on one knee beside him and threw open his riding coat.
Had I needed corroboration of the fisherman’s words, I
received it then, and the mystery as to why he had retained
his coat in the cabin was at once made clear.
For beneath it he was clad in a suit of violet-coloured
velvet and his breast glittered with the insignia of some
half dozen orders, among which my eyes fell upon the
blue ribbon of the Garter and the Order of St. Louis.
The hilt of his sword, too, which had been concealed
before by his outer coat, was thickly studded with jewels,
though the blade itself was of the finest Toledo steel, as
I speedily discovered when I essayed to test it. This
latter weapon I did not hesitate to appropriate for my
own use, and it was with a sigh of satisfaction that I
fastened it to my side; for ’tis wonderful what a feeling
of security may be given to a man by the possession of
three feet of good honest steel.</p>

<p>Oh, it was all clear to me now—clear as daylight! As
James’s most trusted councillor, having great influence in
Devonshire and the adjacent counties, he had been hurriedly
dispatched by his master to create a diversion in
his favour by heading a general rising of the Jacobites
throughout the West. By which means James relied
upon William withdrawing some of his veteran troops
from Ireland to quell it. That it was a plan hurriedly
formed and as hurriedly executed was plain, seeing that
the earl had not had time to don any disguise ere proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
on board. I bade my unwilling host bring
water, and with this I bathed my companion’s wound and
again adjusted the bandage.</p>

<p>“He will do now,” I said briefly to my host, who had
drawn slowly near, watching the proceedings with
marked attention. “Leave me to think, my friend!”</p>

<p>He drew back at that into a corner of the hut and stood
furtively regarding me, whilst I seated myself upon the
stool at my patient’s side and rapidly reflected how best
I could profit by this unexpected development. For
some little time I remained buried in thought, reviewing
in all its details a scheme which gradually increased
in favour with me the more I conned it. With so much
satisfaction did it present itself to my mind that my
breath grew quicker at the thought, and I moistened
my dry lips in pleasurable anticipation. Indeed, so absorbed
was I in my own thoughts that it was with a start
of genuine surprise I heard from without the sharp clink
of a hoof striking against a stone, with the sound of a
hearty oath. I sprang to my feet and laid my hand
upon my sword. I had my own reasons for not desiring
any company at that moment.</p>

<p>“The door, fool!” I cried to the old man, as there came
the sound of footsteps without and the jingle of harness.
“Bar the door!”</p>

<p>But it was too late. Even as the words left my lips,
and as he moved to execute my bidding, on a sudden the
door was flung open, and a harsh voice cried: “Within
there! Can’st tell me how far it is to—Cassilis?” I
think that an oath rose to my lips also; for there, framed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
in the doorway, with his rein slung upon his arm, stood
the man of all others that I least desired to see.</p>

<p>“De Brito!” I cried when I had recovered from my surprise.
“What brings you here?”</p>

<p>“I might with equal justice demand the same of you,”
he answered. “But as I have ridden express from Dartmouth
with a message for you, I may as well acquit me
here of my errand.”</p>

<p>“For me?” I cried in still more surprise.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he replied, drawing a sealed paper from his
breast; “though I little expected to find you here when
I saw the light from the road yonder. Curse me, if I
understand it!”</p>

<p>“That is my affair,” I said coldly. “Give me the letter.”</p>

<p>“Aye, but,” he continued, unheeding my words,
“your uniform—and— ’Sdeath! whom have we
there?”</p>

<p>He had, for the first time apparently, observed the inanimate
figure behind me. And at that moment the earl
stirred slightly and groaned. I had placed myself so as
to screen his face from De Brito’s view and I now hastened
to answer the latter with what carelessness I could
assume.</p>

<p>“’Tis a long story,” I replied, “and must wait the telling
at some future opportunity. But amongst other adventures
I was carried off by a privateer. This is a common
sailorman, who assisted me to escape and was hurt
in so doing.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” De Brito answered with a sneer. I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
read in his eyes that he did not believe my words. “But
that I have your word for it I had not given you credit
for playing the part of good Samaritan. How now!
What are you staring at, old death’s head?”</p>

<p>Following the direction of his eyes, I saw that the old
man had drawn gradually nearer during this brief conversation
and was now gazing from one to the other of
us with a peculiar expression upon his face. Meeting my
eyes, he drew back hurriedly, muttering to himself. I
turned again to De Brito.</p>

<p>“Enough!” I said impatiently. “The man is half a
fool. And now the paper!”</p>

<p>He had no further excuse for withholding it and gave
it into my hands. Doubtless he hoped that I should
move nearer to the light so that he might be enabled to
indulge his curiosity. But I was too wary to be so
caught, and while opening it I still preserved my position
in front of my companion so that he was unable to get a
sight of his face. Finding that I was not to be enticed
thus, he sulkily retired a few steps, and whilst still keeping
a watchful eye upon him I turned my attention to
the letter in my hand. Its contents were brief and to the
point.</p>

<p>“This is to warn you news has been received that the
Earl of Cleeve hath set sail for England to effect a rising
in favour of James Stuart. So much we know from one
who hath betrayed him; but not his landing place.
Therefore, be on your guard. Keep watch upon the
house. Keep watch upon the servants. ’Tis not unlikely
he will endeavour to communicate with his home. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
forget not that a thousand crowns await his apprehension.”
The letter was signed “Colonel Savage” and was
dated July 4, 1690.</p>

<p>With what feelings I read these words, knowing that
the object of this reward lay helpless at my feet, may
well be imagined. I raised my eyes to De Brito. He
was staring fixedly past me, an evil smile curling his
lips.</p>

<p>“You say that the regiment is at Dartmouth,” I said at
length.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered laconically. “What then?”</p>

<p>“This,” I replied quickly, anxious only to be rid of his
presence. “You will return at once and tell Colonel Savage
from me that I will obey his instructions in
every respect. Aye, and if he can spare me twenty
troopers, so much the better. That is all, I think.” And
I glanced meaningly at the door. But for the moment
he made no offer to move.</p>

<p>“Before I go,” he said slowly, “I would ask you a
question.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it, man?” I cried impatiently.</p>

<p>“Do common sailors wear such rings as that?” he answered,
nodding in my direction.</p>

<p>I will own that his words took me somewhat off my
guard. I cast a quick glance behind me, and saw at
once what had caught his attention. The earl had moved
slightly, and one hand hung down by his side, and upon
it, flashing and scintillating in the wavering light, was
the magnificent ruby I had remarked when in the boat.
But I was quick to regain my wits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>“Tush!” I replied with affected carelessness. “Stolen,
no doubt. Did I not say it was a privateer?”</p>

<p>“No doubt,” De Brito answered with a sneer. “And
that white hand—was that stolen also?”</p>

<p>But my patience was fast vanishing. “Hark you!” I
said sternly, fingering my sword hilt. “If you are wise
you will not seek to meddle with my affairs. You have
received your orders. Go!”</p>

<p>For a moment he stood facing me, a dark scowl upon
his face. But he knew that I was the better swordsman
and he had no stomach for a fight. Stifling an oath,
he turned upon his heel and left the hut. I followed
him through the door and watched him mount. When he
had gathered up the reins preparatory to departing, he
turned in his saddle and addressed me.</p>

<p>“Good-night to you, Captain Cassilis,” he cried mockingly.
“I think I promised you once not to forget you.
Well, ’tis a pleasant night for a ride, and Meriden lies
but a mile or so out of my way!” Then in a sudden
outburst of rage he shook his fist at me with a furious
oath. The next moment he had set spurs to his horse,
and I heard the beat of his hoofs die away upon the
night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>OF THE HOME COMING OF HIS GRACE OF CLEEVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some moments I remained in the same attitude, staring
fixedly in the direction in which he had disappeared,
and pondering upon his words; then I retraced my steps
to the hut. At the doorway I paused. The old man
had left his position in my absence and was now kneeling
by the earl’s side, apparently muttering something in
his ear. Even as I gazed he put his two hands upon his
breast and lightly shook him.</p>

<p>Then I entered. “What is it? What are you doing
there?” I cried.</p>

<p>At the sound of my voice he turned his head towards
me but he did not rise. “Aye, but ’tis a sad sight this,”
he replied quaveringly. “There will be sorrow at the
manor when this is known.”</p>

<p>“You say true, old man,” I answered grimly. “There
<i>will</i> be sorrow there—sorrow indeed!”</p>

<p>I crossed over to his side and stood staring for a moment
at my late companion. The colour had in some
measure returned to his face and he lay breathing heavily.
I stooped and gently disengaged the ruby from his
finger, to slip it upon my own. Then I turned to leave
the hut. I had all but reached the door when the old
man’s voice arrested me. He had risen to his feet, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
I noticed a subdued excitement in his voice and manner;
but of this I thought nothing at the time.</p>

<p>“You are going out?” he said slowly.</p>

<p>“Aye,” I answered. “Is there anything strange in
that? I will myself bear tidings of the earl’s misfortune
to the manor. You say that yonder road will take me to
the village?”</p>

<p>“It runs direct,” he replied eagerly. “You cannot miss
the way, and ’tis scarcely two miles distant.”</p>

<p>“Why, then,” I answered, “I shall start at once. In the
meantime you will watch over our friend there. He will
sleep belike for many hours, and see that you open not
the door till my return. You understand?”</p>

<p>He nodded in assent, and without further word I went
out closing the door behind me.</p>

<p>Once upon the road I looked long and searchingly to
the south. De Brito had long since disappeared, and
no figure of man or beast broke the barren surface of the
low hills. I turned my face resolutely northwards and
set out at a brisk pace for my destination, picturing to
myself the meeting with my lady and all that I should
say. I must have been walking for the half of an hour
ere I caught sight of the head of Cleevesborough, beyond
which lay the village. Involuntarily I quickened my
steps at sight of it, and when some time later I had
skirted round its base, I found myself within a quarter
of a mile of the church. It behooved me then to proceed
with more caution, and accordingly I left the road
and, forcing my way through the low hedge that bordered
it, I made my way slowly along in its shadow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
When I had advanced thus to within a hundred yards of
the nearest house, which happened indeed to be the inn,
I paused to consider what course I should next take.
There were lights burning in the tavern, and the dark
figures of men showed through the open windows. For
the rest, the village was quiet enough, and even as I stood
there hesitating the clock upon the church struck ten.
I had come to the decision of making a detour round the
village, and was about to put this plan into execution,
when a distant sound upon the road behind me brought
me to a sudden halt. Far away at present, but growing
momentarily nearer, came the thud of a horse’s hoofs.
Crouching lower in the shadow of the hedge, I awaited
the appearance of the rider, a sudden suspicion crossing
my mind that it was De Brito following me, though with
what purpose I could not well divine. Two hundred
yards away the road took a sudden bend, and it was not
until the rider had passed this point that I was enabled
to get a clear view of him in the moonlight. A single
glance showed me that it was not De Brito, but one who
rode upon an errand of life and death. The horse
swayed ominously from side to side; the rider reeled in
his saddle. At a nearer approach I could see his face,
white and ghastly with mingled dust and weariness. And
then, when within twenty yards of the spot where I lay
concealed, on a sudden horse and rider came crashing
to the ground, a widening pool of blood spreading from
the former’s mouth and nostrils telling its own tale. The
horse had been ridden literally to the death. Yet the
man stayed but to cast one glance at her and then staggered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
rather than walked in the direction of the
village.</p>

<p>’Twas then that, rising to my feet, I kept pace with
him upon the opposite side of the hedge, for I was determined
to ascertain the nature of his business. When
he entered the courtyard of the inn I was, all unperceived
by him, close enough to hear what followed, though it
would have taken a sharp pair of eyes to have detected
me in the deep shadow cast by the building. The man
made straight for the open door before him, at the same
time shouting hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Ho there, landlord! a cup of brandy and a horse, in
the King’s name!”</p>

<p>His words drew a dozen heads to the windows and a
moment later the landlord himself appeared in the doorway.
Over his shoulder I caught a glimpse of my old
acquaintance the steward.</p>

<p>“Who calls so late? What do you wish, friend?”
said the landlord.</p>

<p>“Food, drink, and a horse, in the King’s name; for I
have ridden my own to the death, and must be in Exeter
ere dawn,” the other answered.</p>

<p>“What!” cried the host. “You carry news belike?”</p>

<p>“News?” replied the other in a firmer tone. “Aye—news
from Ireland. Great news!—glorious news!”</p>

<p>Then raising his voice so that all might hear, he continued:
“Three days ago a great battle was fought
upon the banks of the Boyne, in which James’s army was
totally defeated. By this time William is in Dublin.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was a silence of sheer dismay following
his words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“And King James?” faltered the steward at length.</p>

<p>“The <i>late</i> king thou meanest, friend,” said the other
sternly.</p>

<p>“James Stuart fled from the field and, upbraiding those
around him, embarked at Kinsale and escaped to France,
leaving those who were worthy of a better leader to
make their own submission. All fear of him is at an end!
God save King William!”</p>

<p>And faintly from the group behind came in echo, “God
save King William!”</p>

<p>I waited to hear no more. Pressing my hat low upon
my brow, I left the shadow of the wall in which I had
been standing and ran swiftly down the village street.
No one was abroad to question me; scarcely a light
showed in any of the houses on either side; and quickly
as I knew the news that I had heard would spread, for the
present at least I had the start of them.</p>

<p>Now to put my scheme of revenge into execution—to
obtain an interview with my lady.</p>

<p>At the end of the street I turned aside and plunged into
the narrow path leading through the woods. It was
darker here beneath the trees, though the moonlight filtered
through the leaves and lay in silvery patches at my
feet. But with my heart growing hotter with revenge,
the nearer that I drew to its consummation, I pushed
on, reckless of the briars that clutched at me, as if they
would have impeded my progress, and cursing at every
spreading root that tripped me up, and at the sudden
turnings of the path that, as often as not, precipitated
me into the bushes that skirted it on either side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Upon arriving at the end of the wood I paused for a
moment beneath the shadow of the trees. There were
lights in the lower windows of the manor. Evidently the
household had not yet retired for the night. I loosened
my sword in its sheath and made my way slowly along
the terrace, as once before I had done upon that memorable
night when I had surprised my lady and her Jacobite
friends—to the latter’s disadvantage. The windows of
the dining hall were open, and arriving safely at the
nearest one, I cautiously peered into the room. In the
silence of the night I could hear the loud beating of my
own heart; for my lady herself was within a few feet of
me! She was seated at the spinet, and was, as far as I could
see, alone. Her back was towards me, and as yet she
was all unconscious of my presence. Even as I stood
watching her, she swept her fingers over the keys and
broke out into a low, dreamy love-song, the passionate
cadence of which held me spellbound—forgetful of the
errand that had brought me there. Nay more, forgetful
even of the insults I had suffered at this woman’s
hands; but with vague regrets rising within me, old
memories awaking to which my heart had long been a
stranger.</p>

<p>The song ceased, the last sad echoes floated out to me
and died away upon the night, and my lady leaned her
head upon her hand and remained lost in reverie.</p>

<p>Bah! Was this Captain Cassilis, whose sword was
known and feared throughout the Lowlands, or was it
some love-sick stripling enraptured at the sound of his
mistress’s voice? I passed my hand across my eyes, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
a sudden dimness had clouded their vision. Then I drew
a long breath and stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“Madam!” I said in a low voice. She did not turn her
head.</p>

<p>“I wish for nothing,” she answered absently.</p>

<p>I saw that she took me for one of her servants and
with a grim smile I advanced a few steps towards her.
“Yet I think, madam,” I replied, “that it would be as
well to give me your attention.”</p>

<p>She turned then indeed, and at sight of me she rose to
her feet with a cry of surprise.</p>

<p>“You?” she cried, the brilliant colour deserting her
cheeks. “You here?”</p>

<p>“As you see, madam,” I answered with a mocking bow,
my heart hardening, all softer feelings deserting my
breast. “No thanks to your ladyship, however, that I
am not at present bound for a French prison or for that
equally desirable place of residence—a Moorish galley.”</p>

<p>“Such being the case, sir,” she replied quickly, “why
do you again venture where at a word from me my servants
will arrest you?”</p>

<p>“Because, madam,” I answered coolly, “circumstances
have arisen that no longer render your servants dangerous
to me—and that also place your ladyship in a somewhat
unenviable position.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand you, sir,” she said coldly. “And
I do not know what sins I have committed that heaven
should send me the degradation of again having you beneath
my roof; but if you have anything to say to me,
I pray you be as brief as possible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“Then I will come to the point, madam,” I answered
calmly. “To be brief, James has been signally defeated
upon the banks of the Boyne, and fled, like the craven he
is, to lick the boots of his master Louis. William is in
Dublin. The star of the Stuarts is set for ever!”</p>

<p>She could not altogether suppress a start of surprise at
my words; but the next moment she had drawn herself
erect and her eyes blazed with scorn.</p>

<p>“It is not true!” she cried passionately. “It is not
true! I will <i>not</i> believe!” Yet her face had grown of
marble whiteness.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I replied coolly, “that I again venture my
person beneath your roof should be sufficient warrant of
the truth of my words. The messenger has but just arrived
in the village. More than that, in a few minutes
your own steward will be here to confirm my statement.”</p>

<p>“Yet,” she faltered, struggling against the conviction
of the truth. “But no—it is impossible! You are lying
to me, sir,” she continued in a firmer tone. “There were
brave men, experienced soldiers, with James. Would he
be so base as to desert those who risked their lives and
fortunes for him?” I shrugged my shoulders carelessly.</p>

<p>“Do not deceive yourself, madam,” I made answer.
“Carry your mind back to the past. Hast James Stuart
ever shown any consideration for others when his own
worthless life was in danger? The man who could steal
away from his palace by night, without striking one blow
for his crown and kingdom, would care little what fate
befell those who had supported him. Your own heart
tells you that I speak the truth,” I ended quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>She raised her hand in a gesture half of protest. “And
these gentlemen?” she cried passionately. “Do you
think, sir, that my brother is a man to seek safety in
flight? To desert those who have faithfully followed
him?”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I answered grimly—the moment of
my triumph was very near—“I <i>know</i> that he did not.”</p>

<p>Something in my face must have attracted her attention,
for I saw a sudden look of fear creep into her eyes.</p>

<p>“You <i>know</i>?” she faltered. “<i>What</i> do you know?”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that,” I answered. “There is a chair
beside you. Will you not be seated, madam?” I continued
with mock politeness. “I fear that the tidings I
have brought have not been wholly welcome to you!”</p>

<p>She looked at me with something of her old look of
repulsion; nevertheless, I could see that she was strangely
agitated as she sank into the chair that I had indicated.
I took a step nearer to her.</p>

<p>“When,” I commenced slowly, “two days ago, with the
generosity characteristic of you, you sent me on board
that vessel, you imagined that I had passed out of your
life for ever. But there was one thing you had omitted
to take into consideration—the nature of the man with
whom you had to deal. I am no child to sit down and accept
my fate with folded hands, but a man skilful in
resource, and of much experience. Moreover, the debt
between us is over heavy.”</p>

<p>“All this is superfluous, sir,” she interrupted. “If
there is nothing else for me to hear——?”</p>

<p>“Very well, madam,” I continued. “I forgot that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
could have very little interest for you. Suffice it, then,
to say that I escaped from this vessel at no small risk to
myself, and drifted throughout the night, without food,
without shelter, in an open boat—alone.”</p>

<p>“Still, sir,” she said impatiently, half rising from her
chair, “I do not see the connection——”</p>

<p>I checked her with a movement of my hand. “I pray
you hear me out, madam,” I continued firmly. “I promise
you that I shall not detain you long. At daybreak
this morning I was sighted by a small brig, whose master
thereupon bore down to my assistance and took me
on board. This little vessel I found had come from
Ireland, and she carried one passenger on board—a
gentleman!”</p>

<p>I paused and gazed fixedly at my lady. She did not
speak, but I heard her catch her breath sharply, and
again I saw that look of fear in her eyes. I think that
at last she had a suspicion of the truth.</p>

<p>“He was a very handsome gentleman, of a singularly
noble presence; and his face seemed in a manner to be
familiar to me. This, again, can be of little interest to
you, madam.”</p>

<p>Again I paused; then I continued more slowly:—</p>

<p>“I will not dwell longer upon the events of the day, but
will merely state that some few hours ago, in the company
of this gentleman, I left the vessel. There were but
our two selves in the boat, madam, and by some misadventure
it capsized in landing, whereby my companion
sustained somewhat severe injury.”</p>

<p>My lady gave a cry of pain, and again as I looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
her white, drawn face I felt the same chill, shrinking
sensation I had experienced in the wood. But I resolutely
put it from me and continued:</p>

<p>“I bore him in safety to the land, madam, and procuring
assistance, had him carried—but there, it cannot interest
your ladyship where he was carried; I left him in
safe hands, however, and it was in passing through the
village on my way here that I learned the news that
I have already related to you.”</p>

<p>She had risen to her feet while I was speaking, and
now faced me with trembling limbs and heaving
bosom.</p>

<p>“And—this—this gentleman?” she almost whispered.</p>

<p>I drew still nearer to her and met her gaze firmly. It
was the moment of my revenge.</p>

<p>“Is Cecil Ingram, Earl of Cleeve, whose life is forfeit
upon English soil, and whom one word of mine consigns—to
the block!”</p>

<p>There was silence in the room—silence unbroken.
Twice she raised her hand to her throat and essayed to
speak, but no words came from her trembling lips. Then
she swayed slightly so that she was fain to seek the support
of a small table that stood beside the chair in which
she had been sitting. I took a quick step towards her,
for I thought that she would fall; but she waived me
back and struggled to regain a momentary composure.
Ah, my lady, my lady! If you had never suffered in
your life before, you suffered then, as there rose before
your eyes the vision of a ruined house—a fallen cause—a
brother’s trial—the Tower—the scaffold!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>“The proof?” she gasped at length, her hands pressed
to her bosom, her eyes like those of an animal at bay.
“The proof of what you say?”</p>

<p>“Is here,” I answered, unbuckling the rapier at my
side and laying it upon the table before her. “Doubtless
you will recognise your brother’s sword!”</p>

<p>She bent to scan the hilt, and a low moan of pain
escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“Or if you seek still further evidence,” I continued relentlessly,
“I have that also. Do you know this ring,
madam?” and I stripped the ruby from my finger and
held it out to her.</p>

<p>She took it from my hand, and even as she did so my
thoughts flew back to our first meeting in that very hall,
when she had so scornfully refused to accept the warrant
of arrest from me; but now fear and misfortune had
broken down her pride. I suppose that the ring itself
was a family heirloom, for it required but a single glance
for her to recognise it.</p>

<p>“It is his ring—his ring!” she cried; then in a broken
voice she added: “God—help—us!”</p>

<p>Her trembling knees would no longer support her;
she sank back into the chair, and flinging out her arms
upon the table, bowed her proud head upon them and
gave way to passionate weeping.</p>

<p>And I—I stood there by the table gazing down at her
with a host of conflicting emotions in my breast. The
thought, indeed, crossed my mind that this might be but
another trick simulated to arouse my compassion; but
in a moment I put the idea from me. This was no pretence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
but the despairing sobs of one who had abandoned
hope. And it was precisely the one thing that I had not
taken into account. That she would meet me with anger
and defiance I had taken for granted; that this attitude
would then give way to one of pleading I had also
equally imagined and had been prepared to gloat over
her humiliation. But this hopeless misery disarmed me.
My lady proud, my lady scornful—that was but natural,
was but the fitting heritage of her birth and beauty.
But my lady in tears was a factor so improbable that it
had never entered into my calculations. As I stood, gazing
upon her bowed head, minute by minute I felt my
former anger against her evaporating. And then on a
sudden, a strange thing happened. For before my eyes
rose a vision of my father long since dead. Of a manly,
kindly hearted, stainless gentleman, whose creed had
been, “A gentleman’s word is his bond,” and whose life
had been spent in living up to those ideals which the majority
of men admire but disregard. Following this,
came one of a sweet-faced, gentle mother, gazing at me
with sad, reproachful eyes—a pure, spiritual face that
seemed to stand between me and the object of my vengeance,
pleading with me to show mercy for the sake of
their common womanhood. How long the vision lasted
I do not know, but I uttered a stifled cry and covered
my eyes with my hand. When I removed the latter it was
gone, and I saw only the brightly lighted room and the
stricken figure of the woman before me. But though my
knees were trembling and the perspiration gathered
thickly on my forehead, a strange new resolution was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
forming in my breast. I felt like a man who had been
snatched from the edge of a precipice, and I shuddered
to think how near I had come to the brink—how near I
had come to bartering man’s highest privilege—that
of protection—for the sake of an empty revenge. A
revenge, too, directed by me—I, a strong man, against
a lady—a woman—God’s finished work!</p>

<p>My first feeling was one of overwhelming shame, but
following hard upon this a great pity filled my breast.
Thank God I was still a gentleman!</p>

<p>“Madam!” I said gently, bending over the table.</p>

<p>She did not raise her head; her sobs had ceased; she
was very still. Something in her attitude attracted my
attention. I passed round the table and lightly touched
her arm; then, meeting with no response, I sank on my
knees at her side and gently drew one arm from before
her face. It was as I had thought—she had fainted.
Seeing this, I raised her tenderly, so that her head
rested upon the cushions of the chair; then I fell to chafing
her cold hands. And at this moment, as I knelt with
my lady’s hand in mine, there came the sound of hurried
footsteps in the hall, the door was flung wide open,
and on the threshold stood the Earl of Cleeve himself,
and behind him Mistress Grace.</p>

<p>To say that I was surprised at the sudden appearance
of the man whom but an hour before I had left lying in
the fisherman’s hut, to all appearance grievously
wounded, would but inadequately describe my feelings.
So astounded was I, that I remained staring up at him
still with my lady’s hand in mine. He had removed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
bandage from his forehead and the long, ragged scar
showed plainly in the light.</p>

<p>“Your Grace?” I stammered; and again: “Your
Grace?”</p>

<p>I rose to my feet and fell back a few paces. And as
with a cry of fear and compassion Mistress Grace hurried
to her sister’s side, the earl stepped forward and
confronted me.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered, his voice stern and cold, his courteous
manner disappeared. “I suppose my unlooked-for
appearance upsets your plans, sir. I thank God I am
in time to save my sister’s honour.”</p>

<p>I started as if I had received a blow.</p>

<p>“Her honour!” was all that I could stammer. “Her
honour!”</p>

<p>“I have said it,” he answered coldly, at the same time
possessing himself of the sword which I had foolishly
left upon the table. “The old man yonder was no fool.
I am acquainted with your unsavoury reputation, and followed
fast upon your heels. Once at the village it was
an easy matter to procure a horse.” In a moment I
saw it all. The old man must at some time have heard
my name—doubtless when he had been drinking at the
inn. I remembered how that De Brito had used it at our
meeting in the hut; and this, coupled with the latter’s
uniform, had enabled him to put two and two together
with a shrewdness that I had not given him credit for.
Of course it was all plain to me now. After my departure
he had found means to arouse the earl from
his swoon, and the latter had followed me with but
little delay. I cursed myself for my lack of foresight.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>“You are mad,” I answered, coming to myself. All
those schemes which were forming in my brain were shattered
to pieces by his unlooked-for appearance. “Mad
to venture hither! Have you not heard——?”</p>

<p>“If you mean, sir, have I heard of the ruin of the cause
to which I had devoted my life, I answer that I have,
both that and many things. And I am here to perform
a solemn duty. It is to rid the world of a very dirty
scoundrel.”</p>

<p>I felt the hot blood flush my brow.</p>

<p>“Your Grace,” I answered, striving to speak calmly,
“if you will permit me to explain——”</p>

<p>“Enough of words, sir,” he cried impatiently. “The
honour of my house is dear to me, and honour forbids
that men like you should invade its threshold and contrive
such work as that!” He nodded as he spoke to where
my lady still remained, unconscious despite her sister’s
efforts to revive her.</p>

<p>“But,” I muttered, cudgelling my brains to discover
some means whereby I might evade him, “I have no quarrel
with your Grace—and no sword.”</p>

<p>“For the first, sir,” he replied haughtily, “I am the best
judge. And for the second, ’tis a matter that can be
easily remedied.” He stepped quickly to the wall as
he spoke, and took therefrom a beautiful duelling rapier,
which he measured beside his own. Then turning, he
held the two out to me.</p>

<p>“Choose which you will,” he said briefly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Mechanically I took one from his hand, for my ears
had caught a distant sound from without, and I felt that
I would welcome any interruption at that moment that
would give me a little time for thought. Nearer now
and nearer came the sound of a man’s running steps.
They did not pause at the outer entrance, but came
right on across the hall, and the next moment the steward
burst into the room. His face was pale, the perspiration
stood out upon his brow, he panted so heavily that he
could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>“Fly, my lord, fly!” he gasped brokenly. “The
dragoons are in the village.”</p>

<p>“Dragoons?” I cried, starting.</p>

<p>“Aye,” he said excitedly, “Dutch dragoons from
Meriden—a score of them. They know that you
are at the manor,” he continued, turning to his master
and wringing his hands helplessly. “In three
minutes they will be here. God help us all! We are
undone!”</p>

<p>Meriden! In a flash I understood. Now I saw the
meaning of De Brito’s words. He had known to these
troops being quartered there, and to revenge himself
upon me had gone to their commander. Whether he had
guessed the real quality of the wounded man or what tale
he had concocted I do not know; but it had been powerful
enough to induce that officer to send a force to the hut to
investigate the matter. Arrived there—well, the times
were rough, and too well I knew their methods. They
had speedily discovered all they desired to know and
had then followed at top speed, hoping, doubtless, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
pick up some share of the reward. Truly there was no
hope now, for the man before me.</p>

<p>All this had passed through my mind as it were in a
moment. I was roused by hearing the earl’s voice.</p>

<p>“Dragoons?” he was saying. “Yes—summoned by
this gentleman!”</p>

<p>“It is not true!” I answered firmly. “Until now, your
Grace, I was as ignorant as you yourself that they were
in the neighbourhood.”</p>

<p>“It matters little,” he replied sternly, drawing his
rapier and flinging the empty sheath from him. “I have
still three minutes left to me. I trust that in that time
I shall kill you!” I stood hesitating, for I knew not
what to do. On a sudden Mistress Grace ran swiftly to
his side.</p>

<p>“Cecil, Cecil!” she cried in a voice of agony, “why do
you linger here? Why do you waste the precious moments?
Fly—fly whilst there is time! Did you not
hear? In a few minutes it will be too late!”</p>

<p>“It is too late now,” he answered, “and I have other
work to do!”</p>

<p>Down at his feet she flung herself and clung with her
little hands around his knees, so that for the moment he
could not move.</p>

<p>“No, no!” she cried piteously, raising her tear-dimmed
face to his. “It is not yet too late—not yet! Cecil, I
entreat—I implore you for your own sake—for all our
sakes—to save your life! The window is open—they
cannot see the way you go!”</p>

<p>“And leave this man to point them on my track,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
answered bitterly. “You do not understand. My presence
here is known. The whole countryside would be
searched. I am no Monmouth to be taken in a ditch.
And on my honour, I leave not Cleeve till I have fought
this man.”</p>

<p>I looked at the firm, set face before me, and knew that
though death stared him in the face he would keep
his word. His sister knew it also, for with a low, moaning
cry she released her hold. Then he strode towards
me.</p>

<p>“Draw, sir,” he cried. “Men credit you at least with
skill in swordplay.”</p>

<p>Then, seeing that I made no movement to lay hand to
hilt, he added: “Must I strike you to arouse your
courage? Are you a coward, sir, as well as a ruffian?”</p>

<p>But during the last few moments I had been thinking
rapidly. I looked to the past, and saw little there to
cheer me or regret. I looked to the future, and down
the vista of the years to come I saw myself sink ever
lower until it might be some chance tavern brawl found
me at length a nameless grave. My glance wandered to
my lady and——</p>

<p>“There is no need,” I answered quietly. “I will fight
your Grace, but not here, where at any moment we may
be interrupted. As the person challenged, I have the
right of choosing the ground, and I claim my right.
At the foot of the cliff path leading to the beach
there is a level stretch of sand. That is the spot
I choose.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” the earl answered. “I care not for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
place, so it be at once.” And he strode out through the
open window.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he disappeared than the apathy that
had held me seemed to vanish. My brain was clear, my
will unshaken. I stepped swiftly to where Mistress
Grace still knelt upon the floor, her face buried in her
hands.</p>

<p>“Listen,” I cried quickly, raising her gently to her
feet. “You are brave, madam—I am sure that you are
brave. There is much depends upon you. Try, then,
to recover yourself—for your brother’s sake.”</p>

<p>She raised her face to mine. I know not what she read
there, but on a sudden I saw a new light flash into her
eyes, and she laid her two hands upon my breast.</p>

<p>“You,” she whispered—“you are going to save him!”</p>

<p>“With heaven’s help I am,” I answered quickly.
“There is a chance yet—it is a desperate one! Your
part, madam, must be to hinder these men as long as
possible. Use your woman’s wit. Bid them search the
house. Delay them but ten minutes, and all may yet be
well.”</p>

<p>“But my sister?” she faltered, casting a lingering
glance at my lady’s unconscious figure.</p>

<p>“You must act for her,” I said rapidly. “There is
no time to lose. Listen!”</p>

<p>I raised my hand to enjoin silence. Far away down the
avenue came the trampling of horse. “They are coming!
Now, madam, will you trust me?”</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands impulsively. “With all
our lives,” she whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>I bowed my head in silence. I could not speak. Her
sweet, womanly trust in me was yet another link to bind
me to my purpose. The next moment she had left the
room and I heard her close and bolt the heavy outer door.
Then I turned upon the steward.</p>

<p>“Answer,” I cried, taking him by the shoulders, “and
briefly, man. Is the boat still there below the cliff?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, catching something of my own
energy.</p>

<p>“And know you of any craft in the harbour that would
venture the coast of France to-night for gold?”</p>

<p>“Aye,” he answered, “or for love of the master. Nevertheless,
there is the money collected last week from the
rents——”</p>

<p>“Then fetch it,” I cried, interrupting him, “and follow
to the beach. Haste, man, haste! The precious moments
are fleeting fast!”</p>

<p>Without a word he turned away, and left me standing
in the centre of the room. Then once again I drew near,
it might be for the last time, and gazed down into my
lady’s lovely face, now so white and still. One slender
hand hung at her side. I stooped and, half timidly, put
out my own towards it. On a sudden, I know not why, a
sense of my unworthiness came over me. I bent lower
still, and, raising the hem of her gown, pressed it to my
lips. Then I passed out into the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>OF THE COMING OF THE DUTCH DRAGOONS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the little bridge over the moat, the tall figure of my
antagonist had halted, but upon my appearance on the
terrace he turned his back on me and strode off resolutely
in the direction of the cliffs. And I—I followed him
with a strange conflict raging in my breast. ’Twas not
of fear for the result of the encounter, though I did not
deceive myself but that I should find a formidable opponent
in the man before me. At that time skill in the
use of the rapier formed not the least part of the education
of a gentleman, and I could not doubt but that his
Grace would have benefited by the lessons of the best
foreign masters. No, it was rather a knowledge of the
certain penalty that the success of my scheme must exact,
and a feeling that I was playing a part more worthy of
a hero of <i>romaunt</i>. Yet as my lady’s face as I had last
seen it rose up before my eyes, I felt a simple pleasure
in the thought that I could minister to her happiness.
When all that I had it in my heart to perform was done,
would she then think of me with scorn and loathing
I wondered? Would the memory of me be but one of
shuddering aversion in all the years to come? Happen
what might, I knew that I could no longer deceive my
own heart; that the image of this woman’s face would
be with me until the end. All this time I had been striding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
rapidly through the moonlit gardens in the wake of
the earl. On reaching the pathway at the head of the
cliffs I paused to cast one lingering look in the direction
of the manor. Here and there I could see lights
shining through the trees, but no sound came from the
house to show that our flight was as yet discovered. The
gardens themselves were very still. A few bats fluttered
silently through the darkness. Overhead, the moon
sailed higher into the heavens, across which, ever and
anon, a great star flashed and vanished. From below
me came up the low murmur of the tide along the shore.
It was such a night as might well shame the lust of murder
in men’s hearts by its calm serenity. Light as it
was, I found the descent of the cliff path to be little calculated
to soothe the nerves of one about to engage in
a duel of more than life. But the earl did not even pause
in the descent—doubtless familiarity with it in his boyhood
had robbed it for him of all its terrors—and for
very shame’s sake I followed, pressing, I will confess, as
near as possible to the cliff wall upon my right and striving
to avoid gazing into the abyss at my side. Arriving
at length at the foot of the path, I found my antagonist
already testing the surface of the patch of sand
that I had chosen. I saw that the steward had spoken
truth. The boat lay close to the edge of the incoming
tide. For the rest, the sand was firm, and the moon rendered
the spot as suitable as one could desire for the
matter in hand.</p>

<p>“I trust that the ground meets with your Grace’s approval?”
I said after a short silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>“Excellently well,” he answered, turning for the first
time towards me. “And now, sir, under the existing
circumstances I think that we may waive the usual
formalities.”</p>

<p>As he spoke he divested himself of his outer coat and the
starred and decorated one below it. This done, he tossed
aside his hat and wig and stood before me in his shirt
of white cambric; and then indeed, at sight of the
splendid specimen of manhood thus revealed, had I been
a timorous man, I might well have fallen to reckoning up
my chances of success. But no thought of that entered
my mind as, throwing off my own poor coat, I bared
my arms to the elbow, and drawing my rapier, tested it
against the side of my boot. ’Twas the one that he had
taken from the wall, and was a good bit of steel, pliant
and nicely weighted—as indeed it had need to have been,
seeing the issues that hung upon its blade. Then I advanced
to take up my position upon the sand and, saluting
briefly, we fell to work and our swords crossed. Aye,
and from the very first I knew that I had met an adversary
whom it would tax all my skill to conquer. From
the beginning he fought with a cool determination—a
calm confidence of the result that did little towards
steadying my somewhat wild fence of the first few moments.
For my mind was busy picturing what was
already happening inside the house, and every minute I
expected to hear the voices of the dragoons from the
cliffs above that should tell of our discovery. Never before,
not even when I met and worsted Galliani, the finest
blade in Italy, nor when, before Belgrade, I had slain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
celebrated Azim Alli before the eyes of two armies, was
my skill in swordplay so put to the test. To and fro
across the little patch of sand we thrust and parried; the
rasping of our blades mingling with the lap of the encroaching
waves. But never once, for all my fierce attack,
could I get past that iron guard, and when, after
five minutes had passed, and we drew back for a moment,
as if by mutual consent, to regain our labouring
breath, neither of us could boast of having gained any
advantage over his opponent.</p>

<p>Save that the handsome face of the man before me
was slightly pale, he was outwardly as calm, as self-possessed
as ever, rather as if he were engaged in some
friendly encounter with the foils than with an adversary
whose reputation with the rapier—I speak it in all sincerity—was
common talk from London to Vienna.</p>

<p>But the moment’s breathing space had steadied my
nerve, and when, in response to my brief, “On guard,
sir!” our blades again crossed, the fierce joy of the
combat had entered into my veins, and I resolved to put
in practice a certain thrust that had been shown me many
years before by an old sergeant of Papenstein’s
dragoons. ’Twas a sure and deadly thrust to those unknowing
of its defence; and though I had no intention of
pressing it home to a fatal issue, I felt assured of its
success for the purpose I had in view. But to accomplish
it required the utmost nicety of distance; and so, in
pursuance of my object, I attacked him again so fiercely
that I drove him back to the very edge of the sand. But
once there my wrist weakened, my thrusts became more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
and more feeble. Then, as he gave a sudden rally, I began
to give ground before him. Step by step I retreated,
barely keeping him at sword’s point; and so well
must I have played my part that, as he plyed me with
thrust on thrust and I still fell back, I saw a faint smile
curl his lips. And I too smiled in my heart as, without
removing my eyes from his, I yet marked the exact spot
where I should strike. And a moment later my chance
came. For, thrusting high, as he threw up his arm to
guard, I entwined my blade round his with a wrench
that all but disarmed him, and in the same movement
with an upward turn of the wrist I ran him through
the body.</p>

<p>Without a groan his sword dropped from his hand,
and, staggering slightly, he fell face downwards upon
the sand. In a moment, throwing my own weapon from
me, I was down on my knees by his side. A brief examination
showed me that I had not miscalculated my thrust
save by a hair’s breadth from the spot that I had
marked. The wound was high up in the muscles of the
right breast, and my experience told me that ’twas but
a matter of a week or two at most ere he was again
upon his feet.</p>

<p>On a sudden, as I stooped over him, I heard the sound of
a footstep striking against a stone, accompanied by a
muffled cry. Leaping to my feet, I turned in time to see
the figure of a man hurrying down the cliff path behind
me. I confess that at the sight my heart almost stopped
beating, for I thought that my labour had been in vain
and that the dragoons were upon me. But at a second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
glance I recognised the familiar figure of the steward,
whose approach neither of us had heard in the heat of our
late encounter. A moment later he had gained my side,
and was staring down, dazed and horror stricken, upon
the unconscious figure of his master.</p>

<p>“What is this?” he stammered, his jaw falling. “What
have you done? My God, you have killed him!”</p>

<p>“No, fool,” I answered curtly, “I have saved him!”</p>

<p>Yet for all the help he was capable of giving me I might
as well have been without his assistance had I not caught
him roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>“There, man,” I cried quickly, “don’t stand staring
so! What of the dragoons?”</p>

<p>“They are searching the house,” he answered, still in
the same dazed manner.</p>

<p>“Then recall your wits, man,” I replied. “There is not
a moment to lose. Help me to lift him into the boat.”</p>

<p>Mechanically he stooped to obey me, and together we
raised the unconscious figure at our feet and laid him
carefully in the stern of the boat. This done, I ran to
where we had left our clothes preparatory to the encounter,
and returning, flung the earl’s riding coat, together
with my own hat, coat and sword, into the boat,
which the first incoming waves were already rocking.
Then I signed to the steward to enter.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said briefly, “play the man if you would save
your master’s life. Do not delay to attend his wound—a
little bloodletting will do him no harm; and it were
better he should remain unconscious, since of his own
free will he would not escape. Pull straight for the village.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
Once there, spare not your gold, man. Remember,
he must be well on his way to France to-night.”</p>

<p>“But you?—you are not coming too?” he cried.</p>

<p>“No,” I answered somewhat sadly; “I have other work
to do. You can handle an oar?”</p>

<p>“In my youth,” he answered doubtfully. “But of what
use is it? Such craft as are in the harbour will not float
until high tide, and that will not be for another hour.
They will ride back to the village and will search the vessels
there.”</p>

<p>I remembered then that he spoke the truth. The stone
jetty all but enclosed a small harbour, inside which,
save at high tide, the fishing craft lay high and dry.
Well, ’twas but another danger to be met in the part that
I was about to play. “Have no fear of that,” I replied.
“They will not continue their search. I will answer for
it.”</p>

<p>“Not for such a prize as that?” he said doubtingly,
nodding towards the unconscious figure in the stern.</p>

<p>“Man, man,” I cried impatiently, “you are wasting
precious moments! I tell you they will not search
further because—the earl will be here.”</p>

<p>As I spoke I thrust the oars into his hands, and with a
powerful heave I sent the little boat dancing out upon
the water. And the final impression I had of it was of the
bewildered face of the steward as he pondered upon
my last words, of which I could see he had not
grasped the meaning. But turning on my heel, I
strode back up the beach to the scene of our late
encounter, and swiftly donned the earl’s bedecorated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
coat, peruke and hat. This done, I picked up his
richly jewelled sword and thrust it into the sheath. Then
I turned to look at the boat.</p>

<p>Already it had passed beyond the point of rock at the
head of the little bay, and nothing met my eyes but the
empty waste of waters. Slowly I returned to the water’s
edge and pondered upon my next move. So far everything
had succeeded as I had planned, and there but remained
for me to play the final part. How still was the
night! How lonely the spot! Overhead, a myriad stars
studded the dark vault of heaven and were reflected in
the placid water beneath. The moon looked down upon
me and threw my shadow black upon the beach. The
ripple of the waves amongst the pebbles at my feet was as
some soul-inspiring melody guiding and beckoning me
upward along the path of honour. I had turned, with
the intention of again seeking the gardens, when a shout
from above caused me to raise my head. I saw at a
glance that all further initiative was taken from my
hands. Here and there lanterns flashed upon the cliffs,
and in their light I caught the glint of steel. The cry
was quickly caught up and answered from different directions,
and a moment later several dark figures appeared
upon the path. I came to a standstill and awaited
their approach, for it occurred to me that the longer I
could possibly delay them, the better would be the earl’s
chance of escape. So I drew my sword and stood out full
in the moonlight, a noble-looking figure, I make no
doubt, in my rich dress, beneath which, nevertheless, my
heart was beating painfully. At a nearer approach I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
recognised the blue coats and white facings of William’s
Dutch dragoons. They were part of the troops I imagined
that had been hastily sent for from The Hague at
the commencement of the present crisis, when James’s
landing in Ireland had thrown the nation into a state of
panic. That they did not relish the pathway down which
they must come was apparent to me; nevertheless, a tall
officer, followed by some half dozen troopers, slowly made
their way to the beach. At the foot of the path he
halted for a moment until his men had spread out in a
half circle behind him. Then he advanced towards me.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” he cried in English, though with a strong
foreign accent.</p>

<p>“It would appear, sir,” I replied in his own language,
of which I had gained a fair knowledge in my campaigns
in Flanders, “that there is no other choice left to me.”</p>

<p>At my words his face was almost ludicrous in its surprise.
He was a tall man, as I have said, and of a most
melancholy countenance. I took him to be one of those
unfortunates whom promotion persistently passes over.</p>

<p>“How?” he cried. “Your lordship speaks Dutch?”</p>

<p>I made him a low bow by way of answer. It was as
well to sustain my part.</p>

<p>“As you hear for yourself, sir,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Then,” he answered, dropping his English, and taking
a step nearer to me, “I have the honour to arrest you,
my lord, in the name of his Majesty, King William!”</p>

<p>I raised my hand in deprecation.</p>

<p>“One moment, sir,” I replied coolly. “Ere I render you
my sword, I must also have the honour of knowing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
whom I am to deliver myself. Might I warn you to withdraw
your foot—you are just within sword-reach, and
I am somewhat over-hasty.”</p>

<p>He drew back quickly at that. The troopers closed in
nearer to me. Stout-looking fellows they were for the
most part and eager, I could see, to begin the affray.
But the melancholy officer made no sign; on the contrary:
“If that be all,” he answered with a touch of pride, “I
think that I can satisfy your lordship. I am Pieter Van
Someren, lieutenant in his Majesty’s Delft dragoons,
and son of the burgomaster of that town.”</p>

<p>Again I swept him a low bow. “And pardon me!” I
continued, raising my eyebrows. “In command of these
troops, may I ask?” I thought that his face fell somewhat.</p>

<p>“Well, no,” he said hesitatingly. “To speak truth, my
commanding officer is above; but the pathway is not to
his liking, and—well—” he added, shrugging his
shoulders, “he is from the ranks.”</p>

<p>There was that in his tone which caught my attention
and of which I was quick to take advantage.</p>

<p>“Yet he is in command, nevertheless, by your own confession.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I answered haughtily, “you are a man of
birth yourself. You will readily understand that it is
against my honour to surrender save to the officer of
senior rank.”</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated, and I could see there was a
struggle going on in his breast. True, they might overpower
me by a concerted attack, but there was also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
risk of my being killed in the struggle, in which case
farewell to all hope of the reward offered for my apprehension—or
rather for that of the man whom I
was impersonating. At the same time I had appealed
to him as to an equal, and to be thus classed was flattering
to his pride. I knew what his reply would be ere he
opened his lips.</p>

<p>“As you please!” he said stiffly. And turning to
one of the troopers, he gave a rapid order that sent
the man hurrying back by the way that they had
come.</p>

<p>So there, after the sounds of his departing footsteps
had died away upon the path, we remained in the same
attitudes facing each other; all save the lieutenant, who
withdrew a few paces apart, where he could command a
better view of the man’s progress. Suddenly he uttered
a quick exclamation:</p>

<p>“What is this?” he cried, stooping to examine something
at his feet. “This sand is all trampled—and there
is blood here!”</p>

<p>For a moment I confess that I was taken aback, but only
for a moment; then the wit that nature had given me asserted
itself. “Ah,” I said, coolly, “a little affair of
honour, sir, before your arrival.”</p>

<p>“But,” he replied, looking up at me with a puzzled air,
“what of your opponent, my lord?”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders carelessly. “The sea has its
secrets, sir,” I replied, meeting his gaze frankly. “It
is a safe hiding place.”</p>

<p>He glanced searchingly over the moonlit surface of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
water, as if he half expected to see the body there; I
could tell that he was not wholly satisfied. But like a
sensible man, he forebore to question me further. After
all, what concern was it of his? Had he not already made
his name famous by my capture? Small time, indeed,
had he for speculation, for already the first waves were
rippling gently over the sand, blotting out in a moment
all traces of the recent conflict. And had we
needed a further diversion, it was provided for us by the
appearance of his commanding officer upon the path.
Preceded and followed by a trooper, he slowly and reluctantly
descended. The men had fastened their belts
together and held them like a rope to keep him from the
edge; but notwithstanding this precaution, it could be
seen how he clung to the cliff upon his right, and upon
a nearer approach could be heard to be alternately bemoaning
the errand that put him in so perilous a position
and conjuring his men to proceed with greater caution.
I thought that a smile of contempt flitted for a
moment across the face of the lieutenant, but catching
my eye, it vanished instantly and he stepped to the foot
of the path to await their coming. The descent safely
accomplished, he presently returned, accompanied by a
short, stout officer, whose appearance seemed more suited
to the wine shops of The Hague than to the rocky cliffs
of Devon.</p>

<p>“This is Major Verbrughen!” the lieutenant said
curtly.</p>

<p>I held out my sword to the man at his side.</p>

<p>“Then to you, sir,” I said quietly, “I surrender myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
on parole. I trust that you have not been put to inconvenience
in satisfying my honour?”</p>

<p>“To great inconvenience,” he answered bluntly; “for
which I, for one, see no necessity. But you—you English
are so proud! What a country! What a road! I
am a soldier—not a fly; and I do not like such work.”</p>

<p>What further he would have added I do not know, for
the lieutenant drew him aside and began to speak to him
in a low voice.</p>

<p>Meantime I turned my back upon them all to escape
the gaze of the troopers, who had throughout stood
stolidly regarding me, no doubt appraising in their own
minds the value of the orders upon my breast. But presently
the two men’s voices rose louder, and I caught
scraps of their conversation.</p>

<p>“A thousand crowns!”—it was the major’s voice. “Ah,
my Wilmina! Little did I dream of this when last I
bade thee good-bye; but thou shalt see that I will keep
my word. Yes, yes, the little house that I have so often
promised thee shall be thine own at last!”</p>

<p>“I would have you remember, however, Major Verbrughen,”
the lieutenant’s voice replied, “that to me belongs
the credit of this arrest.”</p>

<p>“So! good lieutenant, I will not fail to make mention
of you!” the other answered.</p>

<p>“It is not mention that I desire,” the lieutenant said
sourly. “But for me the man might well have escaped,
and I shall lay claim to the reward.”</p>

<p>“You?” the other cried hotly. “You will lay claim?”</p>

<p>“Why not?” the lieutenant answered, raising his voice.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
“Was it not my suggestion to search the gardens? Am
I to do all the work and gain no profit by it?”</p>

<p>“And am I not in command here?” the major cried
angrily; “and was it not to me that he surrendered?
<i>You</i> to receive a thousand crowns? Why, ’twould be
squandered at the first gaming table you sat down to!”</p>

<p>“And you to spend them on your Wilmina?” the lieutenant
retorted with a sneer. “Why, she has forgotten
your very name ere this.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” the major shouted, beside himself with
rage.</p>

<p>“You shall answer to me for your words, Major
Verbrughen!” cried the other in a tone equally as loud.</p>

<p>I turned swiftly upon my heel and faced them. The
major’s face was purple with passion, the lieutenant
stood with his hand upon his sword. In the background
the troopers remained standing, like so many blue-coated
statues. Here was an unexpected chance of gaining
time.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” I said, advancing towards them, “in that
I could not help overhearing part of your conversation,
I pray you pardon me. It would seem that the matter
at issue is one calling rather for deeds than words. The
night is still young, and the light will serve. I shall be
happy to act as second to either of you gentlemen, and I
make no doubt that one of your men will be equally willing
to serve in a similar capacity.”</p>

<p>They both turned in my direction, and for a moment
they stood silent, glancing first at me and then at one
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>“I am at all times ready to uphold my words,” said the
lieutenant, still fingering his sword hilt. But it seemed
that my very eagerness had defeated its own purpose,
for——</p>

<p>“And I—I do not fight when engaged upon duty,” said
the major stiffly. “I thank your lordship for the reminder.
Lieutenant Someren, we will discuss this matter
later. But the tide is rising fast, and it is full time
that we returned to the house.” He turned as he spoke
and cast a lingering look at the narrow path. “Is there
no other way by which we can go, my lord?” he added
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“None,” I answered, inwardly cursing myself for my
stupidity in interfering. Had I not done so it might
well have been that the quarrel would have led to blows
and more time might have been gained. Now, however,
it was too late, and all that I could do was to cast about
in my mind for some means by which I might still further
delay them. I thought that the major gave a slight
groan upon hearing my reply. “Lieutenant Someren,”
he said after a moment’s pause, “take four men and lead
the way.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant saluted, not a muscle of his lean face
moving. Apparently he had forgotten their late
estrangement and became once more a military machine.
As the little party moved away: “Now, my lord,” the
major continued, turning towards me, “be good enough
to follow!”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders lightly and obeyed him. He
himself brought up the rear with the remaining three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
troopers. It was not lost upon me that the burly sergeant
immediately behind me carried his pistol in his
hand. Evidently he was a man of precaution and did not
put the same confidence in my parole as did his superior
officers. In this order, then, we commenced the ascent;
nor could I wonder that to men accustomed to the flat
country of Holland the task should be so unwelcome.
Even I, though by this time I had gained a tolerable acquaintance
with the path, could not but be moved by
the weirdness of the scene. The moon threw our shadows
black against the cliff, accentuating the darkness of the
gulf at our side, from which, growing ever fainter as
we ascended, rose up the low murmur of the tide. It was
some little time, therefore, ere we gained the summit, to
find a couple more troopers in waiting there. With the
major and lieutenant on either side of me—preserving,
however, a strict silence towards each other—and with
the troopers in our rear, I passed once more and for the
last time through the misty, rose-scented gardens that
were filled for me with so many memories. Nor could I,
for all my efforts, put the penalty that I must pay wholly
from my mind. For what had I done? I, a soldier,
had betrayed my trust! Had assisted a noted rebel to
escape! and for what? Was it not for a mere shadowy
sentiment such as a man of my experience and years
should not have been guilty? But though I strove thus
to reason with myself, I know that the beating of my
heart increased the nearer that we approached the lighted
windows of the house. For all my thoughts centred then
upon what my lady would say to me, and how I should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
first reveal myself to her, so that the men at my side
should have no suspicion of the imposture practised on
them.</p>

<p>But do what I would, I could think of no way by which
I could prepare those at the house, for my brain was
in a chaos, and only the image of my lady’s face was before
my eyes. Already we had reached the little bridge
and, crossing, passed slowly down the terrace to where a
broad stream of light came from the open door and lay in
a white patch upon the gravel walk. As we passed
the lighted windows of the dining hall, I strove to gain
a glimpse of the interior; but the curtains had fallen
to—I could see nothing. Clearly I must trust to luck
that they should not betray me in their surprise.</p>

<p>Entering, I found some dozen troopers lounging in the
hall, who sprang to attention upon our appearance.
Through the open door beyond I caught sight of their
horses at the foot of the broad entrance steps. In the
passage leading to the servants’ quarters three or four
of my lady’s women were huddled together, gazing upon
the scene before them with white, scared faces. I bent
my head as I passed through, that they might not see
my face, and with the two officers at my heels I entered
the dining hall—to find it empty.</p>

<p>For a moment I do not know whether in my heart I
was the more disappointed or relieved to find it so.
But the fact gave me time at least to collect my scattered
thoughts. Already I reckoned that it could want barely
another half hour until it should be high tide. I turned
suddenly to the major.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>“May I ask, sir,” I said calmly, “from what source you
received the information as to my presence here?”</p>

<p>“As to that,” he replied readily, “I cannot tell you.
I do but obey my orders.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” I answered. “And you come——?”</p>

<p>“From Plymouth,” he replied. “But our regiment lies
to-night at Meriden.”</p>

<p>“And—pardon me—is it your intention to return
thither at once?”</p>

<p>For a moment he hesitated. I think that the prospect
of the long Devon miles lying between him and
his comfortable quarters held but little attraction for
him.</p>

<p>“That will depend upon the condition of our horses,
my lord,” he said at length. “We have ridden far and
fast to-day.”</p>

<p>A sudden inspiration occurred to me. “Then do me the
favour, gentlemen, to look upon me as your host for the
short time that you remain beneath this roof. Even
misfortune must wait upon hospitality. And a bottle
of wine is no mean antidote for a long night ride.”</p>

<p>I saw his eyes begin to sparkle. Nevertheless, he still
made pretence to hesitate.</p>

<p>“Certainly I have no orders for immediate return,” he
said slowly. “What think you, lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“You are in command, Major Verbrughen,” the latter
answered stiffly. He had withdrawn a few paces apart,
yet even his melancholy countenance showed no disapproval
at the prospect.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” the major continued, turning towards me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
“I—will look at the horses myself.” And turning
abruptly on his heel, he left the room.</p>

<p>When we were alone I slowly crossed to the hearth, and
with my back to the lieutenant, who on his part did not
seem particularly desirous of conversation, I fell to
thinking of all the fateful events of the day. It was
whilst standing thus, that happening to raise my eyes
to the broad mirror that hung above the carven mantelpiece,
I saw that which banished in a moment all other
thoughts from my mind. For my lady herself was in
the room! I had heard no door open—no sound of footfall.
Yet there, at the foot of the steps leading to the
corridor above, she stood motionless, and behind her Mistress
Grace.</p>

<p>My lady’s face was white, though still she strove to bear
herself with pride. Her sister made no effort to conceal
her tears. In the background I caught sight of the
lieutenant bowing profoundly. Slowly, slowly she
crossed the floor towards me. And I?—I stood rooted
to the spot, incapable alike of speech or movement, my
heart beating with a rapidity that was not far removed
from pain.</p>

<p>Within a yard of me she stopped, and I saw her struggling
with her emotion—saw the tears gathering upon
her lashes—and I alone heard the low sob of anguish that
escaped her lips. And hearing that, I thanked God in my
heart that I had done what I had. A moment later her
white hands were laid upon my shoulders, and “Cecil!”
she whispered brokenly.</p>

<p>And then indeed I turned—and our eyes met.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>OF HOW I REPAID THE DEBT I OWED MY LADY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment—a moment containing in itself a lifelong
memory—we two stood face to face in a silence broken
only by a low cry from Mistress Grace, as for the first
time she caught sight of me.</p>

<p>But no sound came from my lady’s parted lips, only,
recoiling from me in the extremity of her surprise, still
with her eyes on mine, she raised one hand as if to repel
me, whilst with the other she pushed the loosened hair
from off her brow. Then, drawing a deep breath, I
caught her outstretched hand in mine, and, shielded by
her figure from the gaze of the lieutenant, I laid my
finger on my lips, at the same time saying in a low voice
so that none but she could hear: “Madam, madam, do not
look so at me! It is I, indeed! If you would save your
brother’s life help me to detain these men.” And dropping
her hand, I stepped backwards, for I dared no
longer trust myself to maintain my composure. Even as
it was I felt my voice quiver.</p>

<p>To recover myself, I turned swiftly to Mistress Grace,
and taking her hands in mine, I stooped as if to kiss her
cheek, at the same time whispering in her ear: “Madam,
I have redeemed my word. He is safe and on his way to
France. Time—time now is everything!”</p>

<p>I felt her hands tighten in my own. “And you—you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
have taken his place?” she whispered in reply, raising
her eyes, still with the traces of tears in them, to mine.</p>

<p>“Hush—yes!” I answered, with a warning glance in
the direction of the lieutenant. More than that I could
not say, for at this moment the major returned to the
room. He paused in astonishment on the threshold, and
I saw that his eyes were fixed in open admiration upon my
lady. I took a step or two towards him.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, gentlemen,” I said aloud. “I do not know
whether my sisters are already known to you.”</p>

<p>“This lady,” the major answered, indicating Mistress
Grace, and speaking to my surprise in very fair English,
“I have already met. Madam, your wife—no.”</p>

<p>I dared not meet my lady’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Your pardon, sir,” I said hastily, feeling the hot blood
mounting to my forehead—“my sister also!”</p>

<p>“So!” he said, raising his eyebrows and making what
he no doubt intended for a bow in her direction. “Then
it is for me to beg the pardon.”</p>

<p>I glanced at my lady. There was a lovely blush upon
her face that a moment before had been so pale; otherwise
she showed no trace of her late emotion, acknowledging
his bow with a stately inclination of her head.</p>

<p>“It is granted, sir,” she answered quietly.</p>

<p>“And as to your intentions, major?” I said in Dutch.
“Will you partake of our hospitality?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied, “it seems to me discourteous to refuse
your offer, my lord, and the horses are certainly in
ill condition,” he added apologetically. “What say you,
lieutenant?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>The latter’s sallow visage bore a look of satisfaction
at his decision. “I am of your mind, Major Verbrughen,”
he answered, the reserve with which he had
clothed himself gradually relaxing.</p>

<p>“Then that is settled, gentlemen,” I said decisively.
And turning to Mistress Grace, I continued in a low
voice: “Will you be good enough to see that these men
are served in the north parlour, madam? a bottle or two
of wine—of the strongest, you understand?—and such
fare as you possess. I have that which I would say to
your sister—alone. Will you do this for me?”</p>

<p>She gave me a glance full of meaning. “It is not
much that I can do,” she whispered in reply. “That
which I can—willingly,” and she prepared to leave
the room.</p>

<p>Again I addressed myself to the two officers. They had
drawn together in a more friendly attitude while I
was speaking and were conversing in low tones.</p>

<p>“If you will accompany this lady, gentlemen,” I said
aloud, “she will herself attend to your welfare. Meanwhile,
I beg that you will hold me excused from joining
you. With your permission I would speak with—my
sister—in private.” And I glanced across at where my
lady still stood upon the hearth, with her eyes ever upon
my face.</p>

<p>But for a moment the major hesitated. “As to that,”
he said at length, “I do not know what to say.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” I made answer, drawing myself haughtily erect,
“I have yet to learn that an Earl of Cleeve ever broke
his parole. For the matter of that, the parlour where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
you sup is but across the hall; by leaving the door open
you may see into this room.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” the major replied, stroking his chin perplexedly,
“seeing that it may be for the—eh, lieutenant?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” the latter answered.</p>

<p>“Under the circumstances then, my lord,” he continued,
“the favour is granted. And now—at your service,
madam!”</p>

<p>He bowed as he spoke to Mistress Grace and together
they followed her from the room.</p>

<p>And my lady and I were at length alone. No sooner
had the last sound of their spurred heels died away across
the hall than the pride which had hitherto sustained her
seemed to vanish. She came quickly towards me, and
I saw that she was strangely moved, and that her limbs
were trembling.</p>

<p>“What is this, sir?” she cried in a voice that thrilled
with suppressed emotion. “What is this that you
have done? My brother was in your power, and
yet you are here!—And in his dress—I do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Nor have I time to explain, madam,” I answered
gravely. “Your brother is safe, and the vessel that is
bearing him to France should by this time have cleared
the harbour. Once there, he will no doubt be doubly welcome
to James in his exile. As for these clothes,” I
continued humbly, glancing down at the glittering orders
upon my breast, “I crave your pardon that I must
wear them yet a little longer. Do not misjudge me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
madam, when you know the truth. Believe only that
there was no other way.”</p>

<p>“I think that we have always misjudged you, sir,” she
answered in a trembling voice. “I think that we never
understood—never tried to understand—until now!”
She moved as she spoke so as to command a view of the
open doorway. Then on a sudden she turned swiftly
towards me. “They do not look this way,” she cried in
an eager voice. “Come, sir, come—I will be your
guide—follow me and you may yet evade them!” And
hastening to the nearest window, she drew aside the
heavy curtains, only to drop them again with a little
despairing cry. But not before I had seen.</p>

<p>Outside, upon the terrace, motionless as a statue, stood
a blue-coated trooper. The moonlight shone upon the
barrel of his short musketoon.</p>

<p>“You see, madam,” I said quietly—I had not moved
from my place—“it is impossible.” And I gazed at her
in a kind of wonder. Had it been another I could have
sworn that she was anxious. “Even had it been otherwise,
my lady,” I continued, “I could not have availed
myself of the opportunity. For my honour now has
become dear to me, and honour forbids that I should
break my parole to these men. Yet it is sweet to me also
that you should care for my safety.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but—but what will they do to you?” she cried,
and I saw a sudden fear leap into her eyes.</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath ere I replied. “Madam,” I made
answer, “imprisonment is no heavy matter for me.”</p>

<p>“Imprisonment?” she cried quickly, drawing a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
paces nearer and gazing full into my face. “But you
are sure that is all?”</p>

<p>I met her glance as bravely as I could. She must not
guess the truth. “Quite sure,” I answered quietly.</p>

<p>Yet still for a moment longer her eyes clung to mine.
Then a little sob escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“After all,” she muttered, her head drooping—two
scarlet spots appearing in her cheeks,—“when the truth
is known, it may be that they will set you free.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” I answered somewhat sadly, “I think
that they will set me free.”</p>

<p>She turned away to hide some sudden emotion. When
next she faced me her proud face was so softened that
I stared at her in dumb surprise.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cassilis,” she said in a trembling voice—and I
saw that there were tears in her eyes that she made no
effort to conceal—“do you remember what once you said
to me—here in this very room—that you would one day
repay me with tenfold interest? I think that you have
already repaid—and I—no words of mine can speak my
sorrow—or my shame!”</p>

<p>“Madam, madam,” I cried hoarsely, finding at length
my voice, “what is this? I will not hear!”</p>

<p>“You will not hear?” she said in a tone of wonder.</p>

<p>“No, madam,” I muttered. “I would not have you
abase yourself for me.”</p>

<p>She bent her head so that I could no longer see her face,
but yet her lovely figure trembled with some suppressed
emotion. “You do this for my brother,” she said at
length with a sad little smile, “you risk imprisonment—disgrace—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> 
him—and yet I may not even thank
you!”</p>

<p>I looked at her, and all the love in my heart leaped into
sudden flame. “Nay, madam,” I said gently, “it was for
your sake!”</p>

<p>“For my sake—for me?” she cried in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Aye, madam,” I answered, “for you—<i>for you</i>—and
therefore death itself were sweet!” And stooping, I
raised her hand, all unresisting, to my lips.</p>

<p>She did not speak, only I felt her hand tremble in my
own, and one great sob shook her ere turning swiftly
from me she sank into the nearest chair, and bowing her
head upon her hands, broke out into passionate weeping.</p>

<p>For a moment I stared at her in silent wonder. Then I
drew near to her side. “Do not grieve, madam,” I said
in a low voice. “I think—nay, I am sure—that your
brother is now beyond pursuit.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she raised her eyes all misty with their tears
to mine. “And do you think, sir,” she said brokenly,
“that I weep alone—for him?”</p>

<p>“For whom else should you weep, madam?” I said wonderingly.
And then something in her face gave me an
inkling of the truth. I drew a long breath and continued:
“Almost I could believe, madam, that in your
womanly compassion you wept for me! My lady, I am
not worthy of one tear from such as you. I am not
strong enough to ask you to forget—but only to forgive
me that I should cause you grief!” And kneeling at
her side, as once before I had done, I raised the hem of
her dress and pressed it to my lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>“Not worthy?” she cried. “Nay, it is I who am unworthy—unworthy
of your generosity—of the kindness
you have shown to me and mine. Ah, Mr. Cassilis, have
you nothing else to say to me?—no reproaches to heap
upon me?”</p>

<p>I rose slowly to my feet. “Yes, there is one thing that
is in my heart to say, my lady, if you will hear.”</p>

<p>She raised her eyes with a look of startled inquiry to
mine; then on a sudden a lovely colour suffused her face.
Yet she did not say me nay.</p>

<p>“It is this, madam,” I continued in a voice I vainly
strove to render steady. “It may be that in a little
time I must bid you farewell. Ere that time comes I
would have you know that you have awakened within
me that which had long been forgotten—that which I had
all but lost. My life—the life of the sword—wandering
from land to land, every man’s servant, homeless, hopeless,
has not been such that it should inspire pity in
others—or regret to me. Yet until I met you I was well
content to lead this life, to ruffle it with men whose daily
life you, being a woman, therefore infinitely pure, could
little understand—still less forgive. But now all this is
changed. For you—you have restored in me the honour
that as a gentleman was mine by birth; and though well
I know a gulf impassable divides our lives, yet for your
sake I would willingly face death itself to save you
pain. In that prison to which I go—believe only in the
years to come that, rough soldier though I am, my
fondest prayers were for your future happiness. I may
not say more—I dare not trust myself to say more. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
have done. God grant that this may be the only sorrow
that shall cloud your life!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she cried, rising to her feet with a shuddering
sob, “I cannot bear it! I cannot bear it!” She raised
her hands to her throat, struggling with her emotion.
“I——”</p>

<p>There came the hoarse challenge of a sentry from without,
followed by an immediate bustle in the hall as the
troopers hastily assumed their arms. I crossed quickly
to a small side window, and glancing out saw a party of
three horsemen advancing up the avenue. Then I turned
again to my lady. She had not moved from her position
in the middle of the room. Motionless as a statue
she stood, her hands pressed to her bosom, her eyes wide
with sudden fear fixed upon the open door. At that instant
the lieutenant appeared upon the threshold.</p>

<p>“Verdom!” he cried excitedly, buckling on his sword
and brushing some stray crumbs from off his coat. “It
is he! It is the general himself!”</p>

<p>“The general?” I stammered.</p>

<p>“No less,” he answered. “Who would have expected his
appearance?”</p>

<p>He drew himself stiffly to attention as the sound of
spurred heels rang out from the hall, and a moment
later three men entered the room.</p>

<p>He who came first was a man of most striking appearance.
In age he might have been verging upon fifty,
and his erect, martial figure and clean-shaven, handsome
face showed to the keenest advantage in the uniform of
a general of the British army. As if in scorn of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
follies of fashion, he wore no periwig, and his iron-grey
hair clustered thickly upon his temples. Nor had he, so
far as I could see, any decorations upon his breast that
could proclaim him to be a person of distinction; but
there was that in his face and bearing that needed no outward
insignia to stamp him as a leader of men. In any
company, in any costume, the man’s individuality must
have struck the most casual observer. Immediately behind
him came an officer in the blue and white uniform of
the Dutch dragoons. The third figure was that of
Major Verbrughen.</p>

<p>But no sooner had my lady’s eyes fallen upon the newcomer’s
face than she uttered an exclamation of surprise.
Glancing swiftly in her direction, I saw that her
face, that had a moment before been so pale, had flushed
on a sudden to rose red.</p>

<p>“Sir Charles Trevelyan!” she cried.</p>

<p>I knew then with whom I had to deal. His was a name
of wide repute—the Bayard of his time! A gentleman
of stainless life and simple faith, combining in his person
all the simplicity of a child, with the chivalry of a
paladin of old. I knew that William upon landing had
made him governor of Plymouth and reposed high confidence
in his integrity. Now he advanced hat in hand
and with a faltering step to my lady; and I saw that his
face also bore traces of emotion.</p>

<p>“At your service, madam,” he answered gravely, bowing
over her hand. “Little did I think when last we
parted that my duty would ever impose upon me so unwelcome
a task. Being for the present, however, appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
commander of the troops in Devon, it occurred to
me that I might by my presence spare you such trouble
as lies in my power in this unhappy affair. But,” he
continued in a different tone, for the first time catching
sight of me, “who have we here? Where is the Earl of
Cleeve?”</p>

<p>“Under Providence, in safety!” I answered quietly,
advancing a few steps.</p>

<p>For a moment he did not speak—he simply looked at
me. Yet I felt that I cut but a poor figure under his
gaze.</p>

<p>“Your name, sir?” he said abruptly.</p>

<p>“Adrian Cassilis,” I answered with what grace I could
muster, “captain in his Majesty’s Tangier Horse.” And
now that the die was cast I felt my confidence returning.</p>

<p>“There is something here that I do not understand,” he
said slowly, crossing the room and seating himself beside
the table. “Major Verbrughen, be good enough to
explain the meaning of this masquerade?”</p>

<p>But by my faith the latter was little capable of explaining
anything. His jaw had fallen, he stared at me in
speechless surprise. Even the lieutenant’s lean countenance
had taken a more melancholy cast.</p>

<p>“Let that be my task general,” I said, advancing to
the table, “and first let me exonerate these gentlemen
from all blame. It is a simple story, and can soon be
told. The Earl of Cleeve is, as I have said, beyond pursuit.
For the rest, these clothes I wear should be sufficient
explanation.”</p>

<p>He bent forward and gazed fixedly at me. “And how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
comes it,” he said at length, “that you are in this
house?”</p>

<p>“I was in charge here,” I answered simply.</p>

<p>His glance wandered from me to my lady, and I saw a
sudden light of understanding leap into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he said briefly, and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>After a moment’s pause, in which I stole a glance at my
lady, to see that her eyes were fixed upon the general
with a dawning horror in their depths, the latter again
addressed me.</p>

<p>“So you, a soldier, in time of war betrayed your trust,”
he said slowly, “and assisted his Grace to escape, knowing
him to be the Earl of Cleeve!”</p>

<p>“For the friendship that I bear to him—yes!”</p>

<p>“You were aware he was proscribed—of the penalty
attached to your offence? You did this—knowingly?”</p>

<p>“And willingly,” I answered firmly.</p>

<p>Again he leant forward and bent his eyes upon me.
I trust in that moment that I bore myself as a gentleman
should.</p>

<p>“A pen here,” he said abruptly, pointing to some writing
materials that stood upon an oaken cabinet near.</p>

<p>The Dutch officer who had accompanied him stepped
forward and laid them before him. After writing a few
lines in a silence unbroken in the room save for the
scratching of the pen, he raised his head.</p>

<p>“Colonel Zulestein,” he said curtly, “you will see to the
carrying out of this sentence, for which this shall be
your warrant.” And he held the paper out to him.</p>

<p>Ere the latter could take it, however, my lady, who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
drawn gradually nearer to the table while he had
been writing, snatched the paper from his hand. But no
sooner had her eyes fallen upon what was written there
than a cry of pain escaped her lips.</p>

<p>“To be shot!” she cried wildly. “To be shot at dawn!”
She swayed so violently that I took a step or two forward
to assist her. Even the general had risen to his feet at
sight of her distress.</p>

<p>“Madam, I would have spared you this had I but
known,” he said quickly. “But my duty is imperative.”</p>

<p>She did not answer him—she did not even seem to hear.
Only for a moment she raised her hands to her brow and
a single sob broke the silence of the room. Then she
turned and came towards me. And I? I awaited her
approach, my hands clenched, my knees trembling.
Within a pace of me she stopped, and her eyes, wide and
fear-stricken, seemed to read my inmost thoughts.</p>

<p>“When,” she said at length in a low, strained voice,
“you did this for me you <i>knew</i>?”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Still for a moment longer her eyes clung to mine, ere,
turning, she moved slowly to where the general stood beside
the table. “Send these men away!” she said in a
low voice, though every word was plain to hear. The
room was very still. For a moment he looked surprised,
then:</p>

<p>“Major Verbrughen,” he said sternly, “it would be well
for you to make enquiries at the harbour. I think that
you will find there all that we wish to know. And another
time, sir, be not so hasty in jumping to conclusions!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
Colonel Zulestein, be good enough to remain within
call!”</p>

<p>The three officers saluted with military brevity and left
the room.</p>

<p>“Now, madam,” he continued, reseating himself, “you
wish to speak to me?”</p>

<p>Even from where I stood I could see that it was only
with an effort that she conquered her emotion as she
drew a step nearer to him.</p>

<p>“Sir Charles Trevelyan,” she said in a low voice, “a
year ago you did me the honour to ask me to become your
wife. Oh, by the memory of the love you then professed
for me grant me this that now I ask—spare this man’s
life!”</p>

<p>I stared at her in speechless surprise. This was not my
lady, proud and cold, but a passionate woman pleading
for life itself. I think that the general was equally
astonished.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said at length, “I would that you had
asked me anything but this. With the country so unsettled,
an example must be made—there is no other
course to take. For your brother’s landing and for the
late rising here, I fear I can hold out little hope but that
your estates will be confiscated. Believe me, dear lady,
such influence as I possess shall be used in your behalf;
but this—this that you have asked is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” my lady cried in a pitiful voice, “not impossible,
my lord, for with you rests the power of life and
death, and in your hands lies all my future happiness!
What has he done that he should deserve to die? What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
has he done that you would not have done had you been
in his place—for me? Ah, my lord, my lord, be generous
to me in this!”</p>

<p>He gazed up at her, moved I could see by her entreaty.
On a sudden he rose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>“You ask this man’s life at my hands,” he said quietly.
“Why?”</p>

<p>My lady’s back was towards me—I could not see her
face. But plainly to my ears there came these whispered
words:</p>

<p>“Because I love him!”</p>

<p>I think that a cry escaped my lips. Yet I stood rooted
to the spot—immovable. But only for a moment. Then
I understood.</p>

<p>“Madam, madam!” I cried: “This must not be!” Then,
as she turned towards me, I continued: “I know that in
your generous heart you would save me if you could—that
you would fain repay the debt you think you owe
me—but that which I have done I have done without regret.”
I would have said more, continued more, had I
been able; but such a wondrous light was upon my lady’s
face that I faltered and grew silent.</p>

<p>“Madam,” the general said after a moment’s pause,
leaning forward and gazing into her eyes—the table
only was between—“will you repeat those words?”</p>

<p>“I love him!” she answered simply. “I believe in him—I
trust him!” she added slowly; and turning to the general,
who had again resumed his seat, she added proudly:
“My lord, you have my answer.”</p>

<p>“And yet,” the latter said after a moment’s pause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
“after what you have said, madam—knowing me to
be the arbiter of his fate—you can still ask me to spare
his life?”</p>

<p>“It is for the very reason that I know what you are
that I appeal now to your honour,” my lady answered
passionately. “To no other man would I so plead.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward, resting one elbow upon the table
and covering his eyes with his hand. Stern soldier
though he was, I could see that he was trembling.</p>

<p>“Believe me,” she continued in a softer tone, advancing
a few steps nearer to him, “I am sorry that my words
should grieve you—should cause you pain! But in this
one matter at least I have cast aside all modesty and
shame. Ah, my lord, in your chivalry, and for the sake
of what is past, will you not pleasure me in this? I am
not a woman whose love would ever change; and holding
my secret as you do—oh, be pitiful to me, and true unto
your noble nature!”</p>

<p>For a moment he remained still and silent, then he rose
slowly to his feet.</p>

<p>“There are some men,” he said quietly, “who would
demand their own price for granting your request. I
will not take the hand without the heart.” He paused
and cast a long look upon my lady. “Give me the paper
that you hold in your hand, madam,” he added abruptly.</p>

<p>Without a word she laid the fatal order upon the table
before him, and taking it up, he tore it across and
across and flung the pieces from him. Then raising his
voice: “Colonel Zulestein!” The Dutch officer appeared
upon the threshold. “I have altered my decision concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
this man,” the general said briefly. “You, colonel,
will remain in charge of this house until his Majesty’s
pleasure concerning it be known! Captain Cassilis,” he
continued sternly, “I grant you your life on this condition
only—that you leave the shores of England within
twenty-four hours. Should you be found within the
country after that time your life will pay the forfeit.
Colonel Zulestein, you will see that this order is duly
carried out.” The officer briefly saluted.</p>

<p>“Ah, my lord—my generous lord!” my lady cried,
moving towards him with outstretched hands. He
caught them in his own.</p>

<p>“No more, madam,” he said quickly. “What I do I
do for your sake. Myself I cannot forgive for the
breach of the duty that I owe my king. Yet for the future
my highest happiness shall be to call myself your
friend.” He raised her hands quickly to his lips, gave
one long look into her eyes, then, dropping her hands,
without one glance at me he quitted the room, and the
Dutch colonel followed him.</p>

<p>It was not until the last sound of their spurred heels
had ceased that the apathy that had hitherto held me
seemed to vanish. So my life was spared—saved by my
lady—but at what a price! I turned now to look at
her.</p>

<p>She had sunk into the nearest chair, and her face was
turned from me. My eyes wandered round the now familiar
room that I should see no more, and then with a
wildly beating heart I drew near to her side. She neither
stirred nor spoke as within a pace of her I stopped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
overcome by my emotion. Ah, how lovely she was—how
lovely! Never had my heart cried out so for one
kind word as upon this our last parting.</p>

<p>Though her face was averted, I could gaze unrebuked
upon the soft masses of her hair, gleaming with a golden
sheen in the light—upon the faultless curve of her white
shoulders, her exquisitely moulded arms, and the scent of
violets that seemed ever to surround her was wafted to
me where I stood. And I knew that it was for the
last time—that I must go out to again commence the
old weary life of wandering that, in the last few weeks,
had faded into a distant memory of the past. A dream—naught
but a dream, yet passing sweet while it lasted!
In the awakening only was the pain.</p>

<p>Involuntarily I shivered as the dreary prospect of the
future years rose up before my eyes.</p>

<p>“Madam,” I said at length hoarsely, “I have lingered
to say farewell. I may no longer stay beneath your roof.
What can I say to you? How can I thank you for that
which you have done? What words of mine can be but
inadequate—or aught but poor! What it has cost you
to act as you have done I can but dimly guess! My lady,
forget the words that you have spoken. They shall be
as if they had never been—save to be treasured in my
heart through all the years to come.” I paused trembling,
and waited for her reply. Yet for a moment she
did not speak.</p>

<p>“But,” she said at length in a low voice, without turning
her head, “what if I do not choose to forget. Are
you so sure, sir, that I was only acting?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“How, madam!” I stammered. “I—I do not understand!”</p>

<p>“When you leave this house, sir,” she said in the same
low tone, “what do you intend to do?”</p>

<p>“I shall cross to France, madam,” I answered, “and
from thence to Flanders! There is always work there
for a good sword—there is always fortune to be won
there—or a nameless grave!” With a quick movement
she rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“You go to France,” she said in a voice that thrilled
me—“to France, whither my brother has already gone!
Ah, Mr. Cassilis, will you not take me too?”</p>

<p>I could but stare at her in speechless wonder. Her
face as she turned it towards me was so radiantly beautiful
that the words I would have spoken died away upon
my lips. She noted my confusion with a tender smile.</p>

<p>“There is nothing further that should keep me here,”
she continued. “My sister is about to wed, and the name
of Courtenay will secure her from any punishment the
government would inflict—their services to William
are too well known. But with me it is different. I have
rendered my name notorious, and I am not minded to lose
my liberty along with our estates. Therefore, I shall
join my brother across the water. That is one reason,
sir,” she said slowly, and came to a pause. A lovely
colour suffused her face and neck. From beneath her
long lashes she flashed a glance at me that set my heart
beating furiously. “There is another,” she faltered.
“You shame me to say it—I—it is—oh don’t you understand?”
And she stretched out her arms to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>And then indeed I understood. Understood—that God
in His great mercy had given me His best earthly gift—a
pure woman’s love. Yet for a moment I stepped backwards,
battling with my own happiness.</p>

<p>“Ah, madam, madam,” I cried hoarsely, “is it so with
you? Is it indeed so? Yet how can this be? You are
a great lady, and I?— God help me! what am I?”</p>

<p>A wondrously tender light shone in her eyes. The
colour deepened in her face with her sweet yielding
shame.</p>

<p>“You are the keeper of my heart,” she whispered in
reply; “my lover—and my king!” I caught her hands
in mine and raised them to my lips.</p>

<p>“Listen,” she continued softly, ere I could find words
to speak. “I was proud and cold to you, dear love,
against my own heart’s teaching. I am proud still!
Prouder in your love than ever I was before! I would
rather share your exile than be the richest lady in the
land! In fortune or distress, in poverty or prison—so
that I am with <i>you</i>, sir, I care not what befalls!” And
at those words of sweet surrender I hesitated no longer,
but took her in my arms, and in a long, long kiss of
betrothal her lips met mine.</p>

<p>“See!” she whispered a moment later, gently disengaging
herself and pointing to the window, where a grey
light was stealing into the room. “It is the dawn—the
dawn of hope—and happiness!”</p>

<p>I glanced once at the fair landscape, already lightening
with the coming day, then my eyes again sought the face
of the lovely woman at my side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>“And of love,” I answered in reply. “Ah God! my love!
my queen!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And so it befell that when, eighteen hours later, from
the deck of the <i>Good Adventure</i>, I watched the shores
of England recede into the purple mists of evening, my
lady sat beside me, her hand in mine. A soft breeze
played in the cordage overhead, from away forward
came ever and anon a snatch of song. The crimson light
faded slowly from the sky—faded—grew fainter—died!
The soft summer night enwrapped us round.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” I said tenderly, bending towards her,
gazing too to where her eyes were fixed upon the distant
lights in the home she had renounced, “you will not regret?
You will always so love me in the years to come?”</p>

<p>For answer my lady raised her proud face to mine—with
love alight, in perfect trust.</p>

<p>“Until the end!” she whispered in reply, “and after—in
the fuller life—beyond!”</p>

<p>And what was poverty and exile to me then, for were we
not together?</p>
